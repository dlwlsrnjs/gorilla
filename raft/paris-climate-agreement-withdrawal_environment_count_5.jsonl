    "question_with_options": "**Question:** How does the meme titled \"paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal_4\" interact with the themes of climate change and political actions?\n\nA) It highlights the positive effects of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.  \nB) It contrasts political decisions with environmental consequences.  \nC) It promotes the idea that climate change is a hoax.  \nD) It suggests that political leaders are indifferent to climate issues.",
    "reasoning": "The meme visually contrasts a group of political figures celebrating a moment (likely in reference to withdrawing from the Paris Agreement) with an image of a glacier, symbolizing the environmental impact of that decision. This aligns with the themes of Document 0, which discusses the implications of decisions like withdrawing from international climate agreements. The other documents (1, 2, 3, and 4) focus on misrepresentations of race and culture rather than climate issues, making them irrelevant to the context of this meme. Therefore, option B is correct as it accurately reflects the interaction between political actions and their environmental consequences.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time.

India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

    "reasoning": "The provided documents focus on various misconceptions and memes related to race and cultural stereotypes, which are not directly related to the climate agreement context. The most relevant aspect of the meme is the interaction between the serious formal attire of the individuals and the potentially trivial nature of discussing a significant topic like the Paris Climate Agreement withdrawal. This suggests that the image and caption may be underscoring a disconnect between the seriousness of climate issues and the casualness of political discussions, aligning with option B.

    "reasoning": "The meme juxtaposes a casual image of individuals celebrating with a representation of environmental degradation, suggesting a disconnect between political actions and climate realities. This aligns with Document ID 1, which discusses the manipulation of statistics regarding demographic changes, hinting at broader issues of misinformation and dismissiveness towards critical issues like climate change. Therefore, the correct viewpoint presented by the meme is that it mocks the seriousness of climate change actions, as it trivializes an important global issue in favor of a light-hearted celebration. The other documents do not directly relate to the meme's focus on climate policy.",

    "reasoning": "The meme features a group of political leaders smiling and celebrating, juxtaposed with an image of a melting glacier. This suggests a contrast between their celebratory demeanor and the serious issue of climate change, implying a critique of their actions and attitudes towards environmental issues. Document 0 discusses the exaggeration of demographic changes, which could relate to the misrepresentation of climate statistics, while Document 1 discusses the validity of cultural claims, indirectly hinting at the role of misinformation in political discourse. However, the most relevant interpretation of the meme's message is that it critiques political leaders' perceived indifference towards climate change, aligning best with option B. The other options do not accurately reflect the tone or message presented in the meme.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days.

The text in the meme questions whether genuine action will be taken on climate change or if it will remain as mere talk. This aligns with the theme of skepticism towards climate initiatives, particularly regarding the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nDocument 0 discusses the distortion of historical facts, which does not relate to climate action. Document 1 mentions genetic traits and personality, which is unrelated. Document 2 addresses linguistic mapping to racial groups, also irrelevant. Document 3, while discussing misconceptions about ancestry, does not connect to climate issues. Thus, none of the documents provide specific support for the meme.\n\nHowever, based on the text questioning climate action, the most fitting interpretation is skepticism about the effectiveness of climate action initiatives, aligning with option B.",
    "reasoning": "The meme expresses skepticism about whether true action will be taken regarding climate change, questioning if it will only be talk. This skepticism correlates with option B, which reflects doubts about the effectiveness of climate agreements.

    "reasoning": "The meme's title references the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, which suggests a focus on environmental policy and its implications. The image of a man in a suit talking on the phone may imply a discussion about political or international matters. While none of the provided documents directly address the Paris Climate Agreement, document 1 discusses how misinformation can distort historical facts and could imply a broader theme of distortion in communication, which is relevant. However, the distractor documents (2, 3, and 4) do not connect to climate policy or the implications of withdrawing from international agreements. Thus, the best inference from the context of the meme and the surrounding documents is that the meme conveys the negative implications of withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, making option B the most appropriate answer.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

    "reasoning": "To analyze the perspective of the meme regarding the Paris Climate Agreement, we need to consider the broader context of climate policy debates. The most relevant counterargument could be option C, which points out that the meme may not take into account alternative climate strategies that could be perceived as more effective. This aligns with the idea that there are differing opinions on how to tackle climate change beyond just the Paris Agreement. While options A and B mention fictional narratives and scientific data, they do not provide substantial counterarguments to the critique of the withdrawal itself. Option D is irrelevant since it suggests the opposite of what the meme likely portrays. Therefore, C is the most suitable answer.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time.

    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal_5\" is directly related to the cultural phenomenon of climate change discussions and international agreements, specifically the Paris Climate Agreement, from which the U.S. withdrew under President Trump. Document 0, which discusses cultural preferences, does not relate to climate change. Document 1 focuses on dialects and racial groups, which is a different topic. Document 2 addresses fabricated statistics about immigrant assimilation, which is not relevant here. Document 3 discusses demographic changes and statistics but again does not pertain to climate issues. Document 4 covers a meme about eye color and racial identity, which is unrelated.

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement. Twitter user @MissEllieMae[3] tweeted, \"In 100 years, Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement will be considered the seismic event.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action.

Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad! Greenpace\" on the U.S. Embassy in Germany. Within five hours, the post (shown below) had received more than 58,600 points (69% upvoted) and 2,800 comments.[30]\n\nElon Musk\nFollowing rumors that the President would be withdrawing, Tesla-founder Elon Musk tweeted a response stating that he advised the president to stay.[11] He tweeted, \"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain.\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 4,800 retweets and 16,000 likes in about an hour. When asked what he would do if the U.S. withdraws, he tweeted, \"Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.\"[12] Twitter published a Moments[10] page regarding Musk's response to Trump's planned withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal announcement Musk announced that he would be leaving the \"presidential council.\" In his first Tweet on the subject, he said, \"Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 200,000 retweets and 460,000 likes in less than 24 hours.

Twitter published a Moments page about Musk's tweets.[23][24][25]\n\nMedia Coverage\nSeveral media outlets covered Trump's potential withdrawal from the Paris agreement, including The New York Times, CNN,[7] Politico[8] and more, and Twitter published a Moments[9] page about the news.

A jazz band is playing.\" The post received more than 790 retweets and 1,600 likes within 24 hours.\n\n\nShortly after, people started comparing the band to the infamous band who played as the Titanic sunk.

The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours.

    "reasoning": "The image shows a climate campaigner paddling in the Seine, which suggests a playful yet serious engagement with climate activism. This aligns with option A, indicating that climate change activism is being portrayed humorously or casually. While option B speaks to global cooperation, the visual emphasis is more on individual action and its representation rather than collaboration. Options C and D also stray from the primary metaphor, as the visual does not emphasize individual impact or regional relevance specifically. Therefore, the best metaphorical interpretation based on the context of the meme and its portrayal of activism is that it trivializes the seriousness of climate change. \n\nThe documents provided do not directly address the meme's specific content but do highlight issues related to public perception and misinformation surrounding serious topics, which can indirectly relate to the perception of climate activism.",

    "question_with_options": "**Multiple-Choice Question:**\n\nWhat metaphorical meaning might be conveyed through the expression in the meme titled \"paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal_5\"?\n\nA) The urgency of climate action in a chaotic world.  \nB) The trivialization of serious global issues by distractive behavior.  \nC) The harmony between technological progress and environmental conservation.  \nD) The celebration of cultural diversity in addressing climate change.",
    "reasoning": "To analyze the metaphorical meaning of the meme, we consider the context of the image caption and the title, which references the Paris Climate Agreement withdrawal. The documents provided do not directly address climate issues but focus on racial stereotypes and misinformation. However, the title suggests a critique of the withdrawal from a significant environmental agreement, hinting at a serious global issue.\n\nOption A reflects urgency, which is relevant to the climate crisis. Option B suggests trivialization, which aligns with the idea of distraction in a serious context, possibly depicted through the painting of a man and a woman on a cell phone. Options C and D are less relevant as they do not directly connect to the critique of withdrawal or the urgency of climate action.\n\nGiven this understanding, option B is the strongest choice, as it emphasizes how the act of engaging in trivial activities (like using a cell phone) can distract from significant global issues like climate change.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants.

    "reasoning": "The humor in the meme likely critiques the juxtaposition of personal communication (the couple on a cell phone) against the backdrop of significant global issues like the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement. This is reflected in option A, which highlights the prioritization of social media over pressing global concerns. Document 3, which discusses the significant misrepresentation of facts in memes, indirectly supports the idea that memes can comment on societal priorities and behaviors. Therefore, A is relevant as it captures the essence of the meme's satire. Options B, C, and D, while potentially relevant, do not align as closely with the social commentary implied by the image and title.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

When asked what he would do if the U.S. withdraws, he tweeted, \"Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.\"[12] Twitter published a Moments[10] page regarding Musk's response to Trump's planned withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal announcement Musk announced that he would be leaving the \"presidential council.\" In his first Tweet on the subject, he said, \"Am departing presidential councils.

A jazz band is playing.\" The post received more than 790 retweets and 1,600 likes within 24 hours.\n\n\nShortly after, people started comparing the band to the infamous band who played as the Titanic sunk. One Twitter user, @darth, tweeted a picture of the band submerged in water and Sean Spicer hiding behind a bush (shown below, left). The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours.

The most relevant conflict here pertains to climate change policies, which aligns with option C. The other options (A, B, and D) focus on racial and cultural discussions, which are not directly related to the theme of climate agreements.

    "reasoning": "The text of the meme discusses a campaigner's efforts to urge reconsideration of Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Accord, which is directly related to climate activism, as indicated by the visual of a climate campaigner paddling in the Seine. This aligns with option C, which highlights the urgency and activism conveyed through the image. Options A and B, while relevant to climate action and the importance of Paris, do not specifically capture the urgency suggested by the visual. Option D misinterprets the message by suggesting a humorous downplay of climate change, which is not the intent. Therefore, the correct option is C.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

    "reasoning": "The meme’s visual element, showing a man and a woman on a cell phone, suggests personal engagement or communication, which could relate to discussions about climate activism. The caption references an individual campaigner urging a political figure to reconsider a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, indicating a focus on activism and governmental action. The documents provided do not directly address the meme's content but highlight the importance of contextualizing discussions around racial and historical accuracy, which may indirectly relate to the themes of misinformation and activism in climate discussions. Thus, option A is the most relevant as it emphasizes individual activism while addressing government policy, which aligns with the themes presented in the meme. Options B and C misinterpret the tone, while option D doesn’t fully capture the interaction between visual and linguistic elements.",

Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below).

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change.

Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.

    "reasoning": "To determine the era or generation's culture reflected in the meme, we need to analyze the content of the meme and its context. The title \"paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\" suggests a connection to recent environmental discussions, particularly around climate change policies that gained significant attention in the 2010s. Additionally, the format of the meme, which features a blurry photo of a penguin, aligns with modern social media trends that often use humor and animal imagery to convey messages related to environmental issues. \n\nThe documents provided do not directly reference the meme in question, but they do imply a focus on contemporary themes. For example, the 'Blue-Eye Phenomenon' meme (Document 1) illustrates how modern internet culture often spreads misinformation among younger audiences, which may relate to the culture of sharing memes on platforms like Instagram and Twitter during the 2010s. Thus, the answer is likely linked to the 2010s social media trends rather than the other options that indicate earlier eras. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is B) 2010s social media trends.",

Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants.

    "reasoning": "The meme's title \"paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\" suggests a connection to environmental themes, particularly the consequences of climate change and international agreements aimed at combatting it. The blurry image of a penguin in the air likely symbolizes the absurdity or irony of such a withdrawal, as penguins are not known to fly and the image itself is unclear, reflecting confusion or chaos. Document 0 discusses the implications of racial stereotypes and their absurdity, which can be metaphorically connected to the absurdity of the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. However, it doesn't directly relate to the penguin image. Therefore, option B is the most relevant interpretation. Options A, C, and D do not directly capture the essence of the meme as effectively as B does. Thus, the correct answer is B.",

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously lists a series of political actions taken in a single day, including the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, in an exaggerated manner. This aligns with option A, as it uses satire to highlight the absurdity of such drastic decisions being made simultaneously. The other options do not align with the satirical nature of the meme, as they either misinterpret the tone or suggest a factual basis that the meme does not provide. Therefore, the most relevant document here is the overall context of satire in political commentary, although none of the provided documents specifically address the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh.

    "reasoning": "The meme's caption, featuring a blurry photo of a penguin in the air, likely symbolizes the disconnect between actions like withdrawing from climate agreements and the real threats posed to wildlife due to climate change. Document analysis shows no direct references to the Paris Climate Agreement in the provided documents, but the humor likely stems from the absurdity of a penguin flying, which contrasts with the serious implications of climate policy decisions. This aligns with option B, as it visually critiques the irrationality of such withdrawals. The other options do not effectively capture this satire; they either misinterpret the message or stray from the theme of climate change discussions.

    "question_with_options": "**Question**: In what way does the \"paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal_6\" meme incorporate satirical elements?\n\nA) It uses a penguin to symbolize climate change activism.  \nB) It juxtaposes serious political actions with absurd imagery for comedic effect.  \nC) It implies that climate agreements are irrelevant to global warming.  \nD) It highlights the effectiveness of humor in political discourse.",
    "reasoning": "The meme features a blurry photo of a penguin in the air alongside a caption that lists various political actions taken in a day. This combination creates a humorous and absurd scenario, which is characteristic of satire. The focus on serious political actions contrasted with a penguin, which is unrelated and comically out of place, effectively illustrates the irony and exaggeration typical of satirical commentary. Document 0 is relevant as it discusses the use of fabricated or exaggerated narratives in memes, which aligns with the satirical nature of this meme. Other documents do not directly pertain to the theme of satire or political commentary, making them distractors. Thus, option B is the most fitting answer.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time.

India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action.

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

    "question_with_options": "**Multiple-Choice Question:**\n\nWhat potential counterarguments exist to the perspective shown in the meme regarding the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement?\n\nA) The Paris Climate Agreement is ineffective in addressing global warming.  \nB) The withdrawal aligns with national interests and promotes economic growth.  \nC) The agreement imposes unrealistic obligations on developed nations.  \nD) The withdrawal will not significantly impact global climate efforts.\n\n**Answer and Reasoning:**",
    "reasoning": "The meme critiques the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement alongside other contentious actions, suggesting a negative view of this decision. A relevant counterargument can be found in option B, which states that the withdrawal might align with national interests and promote economic growth. This perspective reflects a common argument used by those who support withdrawal, suggesting that it is beneficial for the country's economy. \n\nOption A, while it may reflect some criticisms of the agreement, does not directly counter the meme's perspective. Option C, while potentially valid, does not address the immediate implications of the withdrawal itself. Option D, while possibly true, does not provide a strong counterpoint to the concerns raised by the meme. Therefore, option B is the most relevant counterargument in this context.\n\nThe other documents provided (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) do not directly relate to the Paris Climate Agreement or its withdrawal, hence they serve as distractors. \n\nThus, the best choice is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours.

    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\" explicitly discusses the Paris Climate Accord and claims it's a scam aimed at transferring money from Americans to foreign entities. None of the documents provided directly relate to this specific topic. However, Document 1 discusses fabricated statistics about immigrant assimilation, Document 2 mentions incorrect speech patterns, Document 3 refers to a false measurement of racial authenticity, and Document 4 discusses the Blue-Eye Phenomenon, which also does not relate to the Paris Climate Agreement.

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days.

India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

    "reasoning": "The meme, which features a news conference with a man in a suit and a caption that claims the Paris Climate Accord is a scam, symbolizes a sense of distrust towards international agreements. The way the message is framed suggests that the agreement is presented as beneficial for the environment, but the underlying implication is that it serves ulterior motives, namely financial gain for foreign entities at the expense of Americans. This aligns with the broader narrative of skepticism often depicted in political memes. \n\nWhile the provided documents do not directly relate to the specific content of the meme, Document 1 discusses misconceptions propagated through memes, which can relate to the distrust theme. However, none of the documents directly address the Paris Climate Agreement, reinforcing the notion that this meme operates within a unique context of skepticism towards such policies.

    "reasoning": "The humor in this meme likely revolves around the context of the Paris Climate Agreement and the implications of withdrawing from it. Although none of the documents directly address the Paris Climate Agreement, the tone and content of the meme can be inferred by the general societal discussion surrounding climate policies, which often include satire regarding political decisions. Given that the question is about detecting satire and irony, option B suggests that the speaker is using sarcasm to criticize the withdrawal, which aligns with common humorous takes on controversial political decisions. The other options either take a more supportive or indifferent stance, which would not fit the typical use of humor in this context. Therefore, the best interpretation is that the speaker is mocking the withdrawal of the agreement.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

    "reasoning": "The text in the meme directly criticizes the Paris Climate Agreement, labeling it a scam and suggesting it benefits foreign entities at the expense of Americans. The image, featuring a news conference with men in suits, complements this by presenting an official-looking setting where such claims might be discussed. This creates a contrast between the serious nature of the conference and the accusation in the text, highlighting a contradiction. Document 0 discusses memes that manipulate facts, which is relevant here as the meme distorts the perception of the agreement. Other documents focus on racial themes and are not relevant to this political context. \n\nThus, the best answer is A, as it captures the relationship between the serious image and the accusatory text.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement. Twitter user @MissEllieMae[3] tweeted, \"In 100 years, Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement will be considered the seismic event. This election will be a footnote.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 1,200 retweets and 2,900 likes in eight hours. Citing an article in The New York Times,[4] Twitter user @BraddJaffy[5] tweeted \"'it is now far more likely that we will breach the danger limit.'\" The tweet (shown below, right) garnered more than 580 retweets and 700 likes.\n\nRadio personality and author Hugh Hewitt tweeted[6] his approval of the withdrawal from the agreement. In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action. Many online noted the aggressive tone that they were now taking due to the withdrawal. Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad! Greenpace\" on the U.S. Embassy in Germany. Within five hours, the post (shown below) had received more than 58,600 points (69% upvoted) and 2,800 comments.[30]\n\nElon Musk\nFollowing rumors that the President would be withdrawing, Tesla-founder Elon Musk tweeted a response stating that he advised the president to stay.[11] He tweeted, \"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain.\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 4,800 retweets and 16,000 likes in about an hour. When asked what he would do if the U.S. withdraws, he tweeted, \"Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.\"[12] Twitter published a Moments[10] page regarding Musk's response to Trump's planned withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal announcement Musk announced that he would be leaving the \"presidential council.\" In his first Tweet on the subject, he said, \"Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 200,000 retweets and 460,000 likes in less than 24 hours.

Twitter published a Moments page about Musk's tweets.[23][24][25]\n\nMedia Coverage\nSeveral media outlets covered Trump's potential withdrawal from the Paris agreement, including The New York Times, CNN,[7] Politico[8] and more, and Twitter published a Moments[9] page about the news.

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall.

    "reasoning": "The meme captures a critical perspective on the Paris Climate Accord, labeling it a \"SCAM\" and suggesting that it is more about \"stealing billions\" from Americans to benefit foreign interests. This viewpoint aligns with option B, which clearly states that the meme criticizes the Paris Climate Accord as a financial scam. None of the other options accurately reflect the content or sentiment expressed in the meme. The documents provided do not contain relevant information about the Paris Climate Accord, but they illustrate the theme of misinformation, which is consistent with the meme's critical stance.

    "reasoning": "The meme in question references the Paris Climate Agreement, a significant international accord aimed at combating climate change, which gained prominence in the 2010s. This context aligns closely with the cultural awareness and activism prevalent among the Millennial Generation (B), who are known for their engagement in environmental issues and social justice. The other options (A, C, D) represent earlier generations that were less focused on these modern environmental concerns, making them less relevant to this meme. Therefore, the correct answer is B, as it reflects the culture of a generation that actively participates in discussions and actions regarding climate change and global agreements.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action. Many online noted the aggressive tone that they were now taking due to the withdrawal. Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad! Greenpace\" on the U.S. Embassy in Germany.

When asked what he would do if the U.S. withdraws, he tweeted, \"Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.\"[12] Twitter published a Moments[10] page regarding Musk's response to Trump's planned withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal announcement Musk announced that he would be leaving the \"presidential council.\" In his first Tweet on the subject, he said, \"Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 200,000 retweets and 460,000 likes in less than 24 hours. A follow up tweet (shown below, right), said \"Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today.\" The tweet received more than 16,000 retweets and 43,000 likes. Twitter published a Moments page about Musk's tweets.[23][24][25]\n\nMedia Coverage\nSeveral media outlets covered Trump's potential withdrawal from the Paris agreement, including The New York Times, CNN,[7] Politico[8] and more, and Twitter published a Moments[9] page about the news. Media outlets also covered Elon Musk's announcement that he may leave the White House council, including Politico,[17] CNBC,[18] The Daily Dot[19] and more.\n\nRelated Memes\nParis Agreement Announcement Band\nParis Agreement Announcement Band refers to the jazz quartet playing in the White House rose garden prior to President Trump's announcement. Twitter user @jonathanvswan[21] posted a picture (shown below) of the band to Twitter with the caption: \"Celebratory mood in the White House Rose Garden for Paris announcement. A jazz band is playing.\" The post received more than 790 retweets and 1,600 likes within 24 hours.\n\n\nShortly after, people started comparing the band to the infamous band who played as the Titanic sunk. One Twitter user, @darth, tweeted a picture of the band submerged in water and Sean Spicer hiding behind a bush (shown below, left). The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours. Another, @GenGriebe posted a gif of the band in the film Titanic with the caption \"Another live shot of the band playing in the Rose Garden\" (shown below, right).\n\nOn June 1st, Twitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to the band.[2",

    "reasoning": "The meme addresses Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which is widely viewed as counterproductive to global climate efforts. This highlights a disconnect between the action (withdrawal) and the expected outcome (global cooperation on climate change), making it an example of situational irony.

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action.

Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

Therefore, they serve as distractors in this context.\n\nBased on this understanding, the question can focus on identifying the structural inequality exposed by the meme related to climate change and its socio-economic impact. \n\nThe options could be:\nA) Disparity in climate responsibility among wealthy nations versus developing nations.\nB) Cultural stereotypes regarding language and race.\nC) Misrepresentation of genetic traits in racial groups.\nD) The belief that visual tests can determine racial identity.\n\nOnly option A directly relates to the theme of the meme and the implications of climate policy.",

Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days.

    "reasoning": "The image of a man in a suit holding a sign likely relates to political themes, particularly regarding the climate change discourse represented by the Paris Climate Agreement. Option C is relevant as it directly connects to the withdrawal from climate initiatives, which is the main subject of the meme.

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

    "question_with_options": "### Multiple-Choice Question\n\nWhat viewpoint does the meme on Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement present regarding global reactions to this decision?\n\nA) It suggests that global reactions were overwhelmingly positive and supportive of Trump's decision.  \nB) It implies that the withdrawal received a mixed response, with some supporting it and others opposing it.  \nC) It indicates that the withdrawal led to widespread condemnation and negative reactions worldwide.  \nD) It claims that the decision had no significant impact on global climate discussions.\n\n### Reasoning\n\nTo analyze the meme, we consider that it depicts Donald Trump and mentions \"Global reaction to Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate deal.\" This suggests a focus on how the world responded to this controversial move.\n\n- Document ID 1 is relevant as it discusses how certain memes manipulate statistics and portray demographic changes, which could relate to the broader implications of the Paris Agreement withdrawal.\n- However, none of the documents directly address the climate agreement or its global reactions specifically.\n\nGiven the meme's context, it seems to convey a negative viewpoint on the global reaction to Trump's decision, implying that it was controversial and likely met with disapproval, aligning more with option C.",
    "reasoning": "The meme focuses on the reaction to Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, indicating a significant global response to this policy change. While the oracle documents do not directly discuss this issue, the nature of the meme suggests a negative sentiment towards the decision, consistent with option C. The other options either downplay the reaction or suggest a positive response, which is less likely given the context of climate discussions.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement. Twitter user @MissEllieMae[3] tweeted, \"In 100 years, Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement will be considered the seismic event.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action.

Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad! Greenpace\" on the U.S. Embassy in Germany. Within five hours, the post (shown below) had received more than 58,600 points (69% upvoted) and 2,800 comments.[30]\n\nElon Musk\nFollowing rumors that the President would be withdrawing, Tesla-founder Elon Musk tweeted a response stating that he advised the president to stay.[11] He tweeted, \"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain.\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 4,800 retweets and 16,000 likes in about an hour. When asked what he would do if the U.S. withdraws, he tweeted, \"Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.\"[12] Twitter published a Moments[10] page regarding Musk's response to Trump's planned withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal announcement Musk announced that he would be leaving the \"presidential council.\" In his first Tweet on the subject, he said, \"Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 200,000 retweets and 460,000 likes in less than 24 hours.

Twitter published a Moments page about Musk's tweets.[23][24][25]\n\nMedia Coverage\nSeveral media outlets covered Trump's potential withdrawal from the Paris agreement, including The New York Times, CNN,[7] Politico[8] and more, and Twitter published a Moments[9] page about the news.

Twitter user @jonathanvswan[21] posted a picture (shown below) of the band to Twitter with the caption: \"Celebratory mood in the White House Rose Garden for Paris announcement. A jazz band is playing.\" The post received more than 790 retweets and 1,600 likes within 24 hours.\n\n\nShortly after, people started comparing the band to the infamous band who played as the Titanic sunk. One Twitter user, @darth, tweeted a picture of the band submerged in water and Sean Spicer hiding behind a bush (shown below, left). The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours.

    "reasoning": "The meme specifically claims that the Paris Climate Accord is a \"SCAM,\" suggesting that it is intended to take money from American citizens and give it to foreign entities. This aligns closely with option B, which reflects the perception of the agreement as a deceptive scheme. The other options, such as A and D, do not align with the meme's message, and C inaccurately states support from international leaders, which is not addressed in the meme. Therefore, the most relevant answer is B. The other documents do not directly relate to the Paris Climate Agreement or its perception, as they focus on different memes about race and assimilation.",

While none of the documents directly address the Paris Climate Agreement, the theme of political leadership and public perception can be inferred. Given the context of political discussions surrounding climate change, option B aligns best with this perception, reflecting a common critique of leaders who may prioritize their own agendas over global climate responsibilities.

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants.

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action.

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

When asked what he would do if the U.S. withdraws, he tweeted, \"Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.\"[12] Twitter published a Moments[10] page regarding Musk's response to Trump's planned withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal announcement Musk announced that he would be leaving the \"presidential council.\" In his first Tweet on the subject, he said, \"Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 200,000 retweets and 460,000 likes in less than 24 hours.

The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours.

    "reasoning": "The meme title \"paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal_9\" suggests it relates to a significant political or environmental topic, specifically the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, which is a contentious issue. The image caption indicates a serious news conference context, likely highlighting the gravity or irony of the situation. The relevant document that aligns with this theme is Document 0, which discusses how memes like \"Global Race Maps\" used fabricated data, thus mocking the seriousness and credibility of discussions on global issues. This parallels how the meme may be critiquing the withdrawal from vital climate agreements by suggesting a similar disregard for valid data and responsible discourse. The other options (A, C, D) refer to different memes or themes that do not directly relate to the topic of climate agreements or political satire. Therefore, the correct answer is B, as it effectively captures the essence of mocking the absurdity surrounding fabricated data in serious discussions.",

    "reasoning": "The meme communicates a narrative that the Paris Climate Accord is a scam, claiming it benefits foreign entities at the expense of American citizens. This reflects power dynamics by suggesting that the American populace is being exploited by external forces, thereby highlighting a perceived loss of power and control. Document 0 touches on the manipulation of statistics regarding immigrant groups, which parallels how the meme distorts facts about the Paris Agreement for political gain. The other documents focus on themes related to racial identity and intelligence, which are not directly relevant to the specific power dynamics presented in this meme. Thus, option A is the most fitting answer.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time.

The other documents discuss racial stereotypes and cultural misrepresentations, making them less relevant to the specific question of environmental policy and power dynamics.

    "reasoning": "The meme clearly reflects a perspective that the Paris Climate Accord is detrimental to American interests, suggesting that it \"steals billions from the American people\" and gives it to foreign entities. This aligns with option A, which discusses the perceived injustice where American taxpayers are seen as losing out to foreign countries. The other options do not align with the meme's message, as they either support the Accord or promote a cooperative viewpoint not present in the meme. Therefore, the relevant document is the meme itself, while the distractors do not support the meme's context.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change.

    "reasoning": "The text in the meme clearly indicates that the Paris Climate Accord is being depicted as a scam, suggesting that it diverts funds from Americans to foreign companies and countries. This aligns with the message in option B. None of the other options accurately reflect the sentiment expressed in the meme. The documents provided do not directly relate to the Paris Climate Accord but focus on memes regarding racial integration and linguistic patterns, which are irrelevant to the context of this meme.

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants.

The other documents (1, 2, 3, and 4) focus on racial stereotypes and memes that misrepresent cultural dynamics, but they do not directly address the climate agreement context.

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement. Twitter user @MissEllieMae[3] tweeted, \"In 100 years, Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement will be considered the seismic event. This election will be a footnote.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 1,200 retweets and 2,900 likes in eight hours. Citing an article in The New York Times,[4] Twitter user @BraddJaffy[5] tweeted \"'it is now far more likely that we will breach the danger limit.'\" The tweet (shown below, right) garnered more than 580 retweets and 700 likes.\n\nRadio personality and author Hugh Hewitt tweeted[6] his approval of the withdrawal from the agreement. In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action. Many online noted the aggressive tone that they were now taking due to the withdrawal. Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad! Greenpace\" on the U.S. Embassy in Germany. Within five hours, the post (shown below) had received more than 58,600 points (69% upvoted) and 2,800 comments.[30]\n\nElon Musk\nFollowing rumors that the President would be withdrawing, Tesla-founder Elon Musk tweeted a response stating that he advised the president to stay.[11] He tweeted, \"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain.\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 4,800 retweets and 16,000 likes in about an hour. When asked what he would do if the U.S. withdraws, he tweeted, \"Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.\"[12] Twitter published a Moments[10] page regarding Musk's response to Trump's planned withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal announcement Musk announced that he would be leaving the \"presidential council.\" In his first Tweet on the subject, he said, \"Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 200,000 retweets and 460,000 likes in less than 24 hours. A follow up tweet (shown below, right), said \"Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today.\" The tweet received more than 16,000 retweets and 43,000 likes. Twitter published a Moments page about Musk's tweets.[23][24][25]\n\nMedia Coverage\nSeveral media outlets covered Trump's potential withdrawal from the Paris agreement, including The New York Times, CNN,[7] Politico[8] and more, and Twitter published a Moments[9] page about the news. Media outlets also covered Elon Musk's announcement that he may leave the White House council, including Politico,[17] CNBC,[18] The Daily Dot[19] and more.\n\nRelated Memes\nParis Agreement Announcement Band\nParis Agreement Announcement Band refers to the jazz quartet playing in the White House rose garden prior to President Trump's announcement. Twitter user @jonathanvswan[21] posted a picture (shown below) of the band to Twitter with the caption: \"Celebratory mood in the White House Rose Garden for Paris announcement. A jazz band is playing.\" The post received more than 790 retweets and 1,600 likes within 24 hours.\n\n\nShortly after, people started comparing the band to the infamous band who played as the Titanic sunk. One Twitter user, @darth, tweeted a picture of the band submerged in water and Sean Spicer hiding behind a bush (shown below, left). The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours.

Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall.

    "reasoning": "The meme in question relates to the Paris Climate Agreement, which gained prominence in the 2010s, particularly during the discussions leading to the agreement's adoption in 2015 and subsequent withdrawals from it. The image caption of a flower arrangement may symbolize environmental themes, which are strongly associated with the cultural movements of the 2010s, including climate activism. The documents provided do not directly discuss the Paris Climate Agreement but emphasize themes of misinformation and social conflict related to demographics and identity, which are less relevant in this case. Thus, the best fit for the era reflecting cultural concerns about climate change and environmentalism is the 2010s.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

    "reasoning": "The context of the meme relates to the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, indicating a potential commentary on the implications of such an action. While none of the provided documents directly address the Paris Climate Agreement, document 0 discusses a trend of cultural memes that distort realities, which could relate metaphorically to how withdrawal affects global unity on climate issues.

He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below).

India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

The 'Ancestry Challenge' and 'Cultural Inversion' memes (Documents 0, 1, 2) provide examples of social conflicts related to identity but are not directly related to climate issues.

    "reasoning": "The meme in question is likely addressing the implications of the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, which is a significant global climate policy. While the provided documents do not directly mention the Paris Agreement, they discuss various misleading memes related to race and cultural issues. The relevant context here is the general public sentiment around environmental policies, which can often be polarized. \n\nGiven that the meme focuses on a political and environmental issue (the climate agreement), option B, which criticizes the withdrawal as detrimental to global climate efforts, aligns with common arguments against such withdrawals. This viewpoint is prevalent in discussions surrounding climate change, making it a likely interpretation of the meme.\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not reflect the common critical stance found in the discourse surrounding the withdrawal, which supports the idea that B is the most fitting response. \n\nThus, the most appropriate answer to represent the viewpoint of the meme is B.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

    "reasoning": "The image caption refers to a collage of flower arrangements, which does not provide direct insight into the issue of the Paris Climate Agreement withdrawal. However, the relevant documents (specifically Document ID 0) discuss the influence of memes on societal perceptions and could suggest that the meme might carry a critical or supportive tone towards the withdrawal. Given the lack of supportive evidence from the documents about benefits of withdrawal (as seen in options A and D), and the general consensus about the negative implications of withdrawing from climate agreements, the most plausible viewpoint conveyed by the meme is a criticism of the withdrawal (option B). Thus, Document ID 0 is the oracle document that supports this reasoning.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement. Twitter user @MissEllieMae[3] tweeted, \"In 100 years, Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement will be considered the seismic event. This election will be a footnote.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 1,200 retweets and 2,900 likes in eight hours. Citing an article in The New York Times,[4] Twitter user @BraddJaffy[5] tweeted \"'it is now far more likely that we will breach the danger limit.'\" The tweet (shown below, right) garnered more than 580 retweets and 700 likes.\n\nRadio personality and author Hugh Hewitt tweeted[6] his approval of the withdrawal from the agreement. In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action. Many online noted the aggressive tone that they were now taking due to the withdrawal. Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 200,000 retweets and 460,000 likes in less than 24 hours.

Twitter published a Moments page about Musk's tweets.[23][24][25]\n\nMedia Coverage\nSeveral media outlets covered Trump's potential withdrawal from the Paris agreement, including The New York Times, CNN,[7] Politico[8] and more, and Twitter published a Moments[9] page about the news.

Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change.

    "reasoning": "The image caption suggests a gathering of people, which typically represents collective action or a social stance. In the context of the Paris Climate Agreement, this implies a discussion around climate policies, likely reflecting conflicts in public opinion. The relevant documents primarily point towards issues of misinformation and social dynamics (none directly address climate change but highlight the nature of social movements). Document 1 discusses a social phenomenon that could parallel public opinion trends, while the others focus on racial stereotypes and historical inaccuracies, which are not directly applicable here. Thus, the best interpretation of the crowd is that it symbolizes a division in opinions on climate policies, as they congregate around a sign likely advocating for or against the Paris Agreement. This aligns with option B as the most fitting answer.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants.

    "reasoning": "The meme in question uses slogans that emphasize the urgency of addressing climate change, such as \"There is no planet B,\" which reflects a serious concern about environmental issues. Option B is relevant as it points out the irony of promoting climate action while simultaneously withdrawing from agreements aimed at combating it. The other options either trivialize the issue (A, D) or create a false narrative (C) that is not supported by the context of the meme. Therefore, the best choice is B.",

Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change.

    "reasoning": "To analyze how the meme utilizes satire, we consider the context of the Paris Climate Agreement withdrawal, which is a serious issue but can also be subject to humorous or ironic interpretations. The options must relate to how the meme conveys its message. \n\nOption A doesn't apply as it claims there is no humor, which contradicts the nature of satire. Option B suggests exaggeration of the crowd's reaction, which aligns with common satirical techniques that poke fun at public responses. Option C refers to the use of fictional data, which does not specifically relate to the meme's visual representation of the crowd. Option D suggests that the meme highlights absurdity through a confused crowd, which also aligns with satirical elements but is less direct than option B.\n\nGiven the nature of the meme and the likely exaggeration of the crowd's response to a serious political issue, the most fitting answer is B, as it points directly to the exaggeration often found in satirical commentary. \n\nThus, the best answer is B since it captures the essence of satire in how it portrays the public's reaction.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

    "reasoning": "The image caption refers to a crowd of people, which suggests that there is public involvement or sentiment regarding the Paris Climate Agreement withdrawal. This aligns with option B, which indicates that public sentiment is divided, potentially interpreting the crowd's presence as a sign of collective opinion. The oracle documents do not specifically address the Paris Climate Agreement; however, they do highlight the fabrication of statistics and misinformation, which could indirectly relate to public sentiment's manipulation in environmental discussions. Options A, C, and D are less relevant, as they do not adequately capture the essence of a public gathering related to climate policy. Therefore, the most relevant interpretation of the caption, when viewed without the image, relates to public sentiment on climate issues.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall.

This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

    "reasoning": "To analyze how this meme encourages critical thinking, we need to consider the broader context of climate policy and public engagement. Document 0 and Document 4 address social discourse relevant to race and cultural perceptions, which can relate to how public opinion is shaped by memes. Document 1 mentions cultural memes but does not directly connect to climate issues. Therefore, the most relevant option is C, which aligns with the need for critical thinking about the broader implications of withdrawing from agreements like the Paris Climate Agreement. It encourages viewers to think about the consequences of such actions rather than just surface-level opinions or benefits. Options A, B, and D do not foster critical thinking in the context of environmental policies.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days.

He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change.

    "reasoning": "To analyze the cultural message of the meme, we should consider the context of the Paris Climate Agreement and the setting depicted in the image. The image shows a jazz band in a celebratory mood, which suggests a positive response to the announcement regarding the Paris agreement. This aligns with option A, which emphasizes celebration of international cooperation. \n\nThe documents provided do not directly relate to the Paris Climate Agreement; however, they illustrate how memes can distort cultural and social contexts. Options B and C focus more on criticism and disconnects rather than celebration, while option D implies distraction, which is not the main message conveyed here. \n\nThus, the meme primarily projects a celebratory view of international cooperation regarding climate change, aligning best with option A.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement. Twitter user @MissEllieMae[3] tweeted, \"In 100 years, Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement will be considered the seismic event.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action.

Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours.

    "reasoning": "The image caption describes a celebratory mood with a jazz band, suggesting a positive atmosphere surrounding the Paris Climate Agreement announcement. This aligns with option A, which emphasizes international cooperation on climate issues, as the agreement is a collective effort involving multiple countries. The other options, such as dismissing cultural expressions (B), framing climate agreements as entertainment (C), or suggesting that music influences political decisions (D), do not align with the primary message of cooperation. No relevant oracle or distractor documents were found that specifically relate to this analysis, but the context of the meme itself provides insight into its social message. \n\nThus, the most fitting answer is A.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

    "reasoning": "To understand the contradictory situation in the meme, we can infer from the title \"paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal_12\" that it likely relates to the discussions surrounding the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, which was a significant international effort to combat climate change. The image caption of a large group of people standing around a table suggests a meeting or discussion on this topic.\n\nOut of the options provided, option A indicates that people are discussing climate change but are not willing to take the necessary actions, which aligns with common criticisms of political discussions around climate agreements where talk does not lead to action. This reflects the irony in the situation, as many discussions on climate change often happen without significant outcomes.\n\nOptions B, C, and D touch on different aspects of the climate issue but do not directly convey the contradiction of discussing a serious matter (climate change) while failing to act on it effectively. Therefore, option A best captures the essence of the satire regarding inaction amidst dialogue.\n\nRelevant documents do not provide direct support for the meme, but understanding the context of the Paris Climate Agreement and the typical discussions around it helps in answering the question.\n\nThe correct answer is option A.",

Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change.

The image caption describes a large group of people gathered around a table, possibly indicating discussions or negotiations, which aligns with the theme of international agreements. \n\nAmong the options, A, B, and D refer to misunderstandings or stereotypes related to race, which are not relevant to the theme of climate agreements. Instead, option C explicitly addresses the conflict surrounding the withdrawal from such an agreement, highlighting the tension between national policies and global environmental cooperation. Therefore, option C is the most relevant choice. \n\nThe relevant document discussing social conflict around international cooperation does not exist in the provided texts, but the context of the meme clearly aligns with C.

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

Many online noted the aggressive tone that they were now taking due to the withdrawal. Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time.

    "reasoning": "The meme depicts a celebratory scene tied to the Paris climate agreement, which invites viewers to reflect critically on the implications of such a celebration in the context of environmental policy. Document 0 discusses how viral memes can mislead public perception, which relates to the potential misrepresentation of the Paris Agreement's significance. Option B directly addresses the contrast between the joyful setting and the serious implications of climate policy, encouraging critical thought about the disconnect between celebration and the reality of climate change. Other options either misinterpret the context or do not directly engage with the critical thinking aspect related to the environmental policy. \n\nThus, the most relevant option that encourages critical thinking is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal.

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement. Twitter user @MissEllieMae[3] tweeted, \"In 100 years, Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement will be considered the seismic event.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action. Many online noted the aggressive tone that they were now taking due to the withdrawal. Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad! Greenpace\" on the U.S. Embassy in Germany. Within five hours, the post (shown below) had received more than 58,600 points (69% upvoted) and 2,800 comments.[30]\n\nElon Musk\nFollowing rumors that the President would be withdrawing, Tesla-founder Elon Musk tweeted a response stating that he advised the president to stay.[11] He tweeted, \"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain.\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 4,800 retweets and 16,000 likes in about an hour. When asked what he would do if the U.S. withdraws, he tweeted, \"Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.\"[12] Twitter published a Moments[10] page regarding Musk's response to Trump's planned withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal announcement Musk announced that he would be leaving the \"presidential council.\" In his first Tweet on the subject, he said, \"Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 200,000 retweets and 460,000 likes in less than 24 hours.

Twitter user @jonathanvswan[21] posted a picture (shown below) of the band to Twitter with the caption: \"Celebratory mood in the White House Rose Garden for Paris announcement. A jazz band is playing.\" The post received more than 790 retweets and 1,600 likes within 24 hours.\n\n\nShortly after, people started comparing the band to the infamous band who played as the Titanic sunk. One Twitter user, @darth, tweeted a picture of the band submerged in water and Sean Spicer hiding behind a bush (shown below, left). The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours. Another, @GenGriebe posted a gif of the band in the film Titanic with the caption \"Another live shot of the band playing in the Rose Garden\" (shown below, right).\n\nOn June 1st, Twitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to the band.[2",

    "reasoning": "The meme incorporates a quote attributed to Donald Trump, which reflects a specific political stance and rhetoric that was prominent during his presidency. This aligns with cultural perspectives prevalent among more recent generations, particularly Millennials and Generation Z, who are often engaged in discussions about climate change and political accountability. However, the specific context of the tweet indicates a more reactionary response to global warming, which was commonly associated with the Baby Boomer generation's views on manufacturing and economic policies. Thus, the cultural context reflects the Baby Boomer generation more directly, given their influence during the political climate of the early 2010s. The documents provided do not specifically align with the meme's content, but understanding the generational impact of such statements aids in determining the correct era. \n\nThe relevant documents (like the 'Dialect Origin' and 'Assimilation Rate' memes) do not directly address the meme's cultural context but help illustrate how misinformation can be propagated across generations, linking to the generational perspectives on immigration and language. Therefore, the answer is A) The Baby Boomer Generation, as the meme reflects the political culture of that time.",

    "reasoning": "The meme's title references the Paris Climate Agreement withdrawal, suggesting a focus on political and environmental themes rather than racial issues. However, the image caption describes \"a white screen with a bunch of different colored numbers,\" which seems to symbolize statistics or data representation. This aligns most closely with Document 1, which discusses the 'Racial Harmony Quotient' memes that use fictional statistics to misrepresent racial integration. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the meme is that it critiques the arbitrary nature of data representation in social issues, resonating with option B. Options A, C, and D relate more to racial integration and expression, which are not the primary focus of the meme.",

    "reasoning": "The meme references a controversial tweet attributed to Donald Trump, which suggests that global warming is a fabrication by the Chinese to undermine U.S. manufacturing. This aligns with option B, as it satirizes the belief that climate change is a hoax and critiques the misguided notion that it is a foreign conspiracy. The relevant document here emphasizes the propagation of false narratives around climate issues, while the others focus on racial stereotypes and do not relate directly to the topic of climate satire. Thus, option B is the most appropriate choice.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement. Twitter user @MissEllieMae[3] tweeted, \"In 100 years, Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement will be considered the seismic event.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

    "reasoning": "The meme is likely drawing on satire regarding the dismissal of climate change, which is a common theme in discussions about global warming, as seen in the tweet by Donald Trump. This aligns with option D, as it critiques the idea that climate change is a hoax, suggesting political motivations behind such claims. The provided documents do not directly relate to the satire in the meme; however, they illustrate the prevalence of misinformation surrounding racial and social issues, akin to the misinformation about climate change. The focus on political agendas in the meme further supports option D as the best answer. \n\nOptions A and C don't accurately capture the satirical element, while option B contradicts the meme's likely intent. \n\nThus, the correct answer is D.",

Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below).

    "reasoning": "The meme references a statement attributed to Donald Trump, which reflects skepticism toward climate change and suggests that it is a construct devised by a foreign power (China) to undermine U.S. manufacturing. This aligns with option B, which addresses the ideological clash regarding the validity of climate change in the context of economic competition. The other options, while related to social conflict themes, do not directly relate to the issue of climate change skepticism or its geopolitical implications as represented in the meme.

    "reasoning": "The meme's context involves an image caption that refers to a white screen filled with different colored numbers, which could imply a statistical representation. In analyzing the documents, none of the oracle documents specifically discuss climate change or the Paris Climate Agreement but focus on misleading representations related to race and statistics. Document 1 and Document 2 highlight the use of fabricated statistics and fictional indexes, which can relate to how the image with colored numbers might mislead interpretations of the text when seen alone. This suggests that the image could serve as a distraction rather than enhancing understanding, making option C the most relevant. The other options do not adequately connect to the document contents or the implications of viewing the text without the image. Thus, the correct answer is C.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement. Twitter user @MissEllieMae[3] tweeted, \"In 100 years, Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement will be considered the seismic event.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action. Many online noted the aggressive tone that they were now taking due to the withdrawal. Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below).

    "reasoning": "The meme depicts a significant political act by former President Trump regarding the Paris Agreement, which relates to international environmental policies. Document 0 discusses how memes misrepresent various social topics, but does not directly relate to this political context. Document 1 addresses demographic changes and manipulated statistics, which are not relevant here. Document 2 discusses fictional statistics related to racial integration, and Document 4 focuses on arbitrary cultural preferences regarding race, which do not connect to the environmental theme of the meme.

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours.

    "reasoning": "The meme is likely satirical as it presents a serious scenario (a man in a suit at a news conference) in a potentially absurd or ironic manner, possibly poking fun at the seriousness of climate agreements while presenting a seemingly non-serious context. The relevant document (Document ID: 6) discusses the manipulation of serious topics in memes, which aligns with the satirical critique of serious issues in a humorous light. The other options (B, D) are related to different meme contexts and do not pertain to the theme of the climate agreement withdrawal or its presentation in a satirical way. Thus, option C stands out as the correct understanding of the meme's satirical elements.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action.

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

When asked what he would do if the U.S. withdraws, he tweeted, \"Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.\"[12] Twitter published a Moments[10] page regarding Musk's response to Trump's planned withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal announcement Musk announced that he would be leaving the \"presidential council.\" In his first Tweet on the subject, he said, \"Am departing presidential councils.

The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours.

    "reasoning": "The image caption suggests a formal setting where a person is discussing an important topic, which likely relates to political power and influence. Document 0 discusses 'Assimilation Rate' memes but does not apply here as it focuses on immigrant assimilation rather than political authority. Document 1 discusses genetic characteristics and is irrelevant. Document 2 addresses ancestry and visual tests, which do not connect to the political dynamics suggested by the meme. Document 3 discusses intelligence and race, but again is unrelated to the power dynamics of climate policy. Document 4 talks about cultural inversion memes but does not relate to the power structures in climate discussions.

    "reasoning": "The image features a political figure (implied to be Donald Trump) at a news conference, alongside a caption indicating that he is withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement \"again.\" This suggests a repeated action that can be interpreted as either frustration or criticism of his stance on climate agreements, which aligns most closely with option B. The other options do not match the tone and context of the meme; they either promote the agreement or call for activism, which is not the focus of the meme. The documents provided do not directly inform this specific meme's context, but they highlight how misleading claims can distort perceptions, similar to how the meme distorts the seriousness of climate agreements. However, they do not serve as oracle documents for this meme. Therefore, the best choice is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

Many online noted the aggressive tone that they were now taking due to the withdrawal. Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme's perspective that criticizes Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, we need to consider counterarguments that could support his actions. Options A and D argue against the need for the agreement, but they are more extreme and less nuanced. Option B suggests that economic interests may take precedence over international commitments, aligning with a potential justification for withdrawal. However, option C stresses the importance of international cooperation, which directly counters the meme's critical stance by emphasizing the necessity of agreements like the Paris Accord. Thus, option C is the strongest counterargument against the meme's perspective, as it highlights the global significance of collaborative efforts to address climate change. \n\nRelevant documents for this analysis include Document 0, which indicates the importance of understanding the implications of international agreements.

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What potential counterarguments exist to the perspective shown in the meme regarding the Paris Climate Agreement withdrawal?\n\n**Options:**\nA. The Paris Climate Agreement has been shown to effectively reduce carbon emissions among participating countries.  \nB. Critics argue that withdrawing from the agreement strengthens global cooperation on climate change.  \nC. Many experts believe that climate change is a fabricated issue and not a priority for policy changes.  \nD. The withdrawal is supported by the belief that it will boost the economy by reducing regulatory burdens.",
    "reasoning": "To understand the counterarguments to the perspective shown in the meme, we should assess the relevance of the documents provided. Document ID 0 discusses the 'Ethnic Expression Scale', which is unrelated to climate policy. Document ID 1 covers 'Face-Swap' race memes, which do not pertain to climate agreements. Document ID 2 talks about 'Cultural Inversion' memes, which again are irrelevant. Document ID 3 discusses the 'Ethnic Forecast' meme, focusing on demographic predictions, while Document ID 4 covers the 'Triple Heritage Theory', which is unrelated to environmental topics.\n\nNone of the documents directly address climate change or the Paris Agreement. However, from general knowledge, we can infer that option A is a valid counterargument since it references the effectiveness of the Paris Climate Agreement in reducing emissions. Option B is misleading, as critics of the withdrawal typically argue the opposite. Option C reflects a fringe belief but lacks support from credible experts. Option D presents a common argument made by supporters of the withdrawal regarding economic benefits.\n\nThus, the strongest and most relevant counterargument based on general knowledge is option A.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement. Twitter user @MissEllieMae[3] tweeted, \"In 100 years, Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement will be considered the seismic event.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action. Many online noted the aggressive tone that they were now taking due to the withdrawal. Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad! Greenpace\" on the U.S. Embassy in Germany. Within five hours, the post (shown below) had received more than 58,600 points (69% upvoted) and 2,800 comments.[30]\n\nElon Musk\nFollowing rumors that the President would be withdrawing, Tesla-founder Elon Musk tweeted a response stating that he advised the president to stay.[11] He tweeted, \"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain.\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 4,800 retweets and 16,000 likes in about an hour. When asked what he would do if the U.S. withdraws, he tweeted, \"Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.\"[12] Twitter published a Moments[10] page regarding Musk's response to Trump's planned withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal announcement Musk announced that he would be leaving the \"presidential council.\" In his first Tweet on the subject, he said, \"Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 200,000 retweets and 460,000 likes in less than 24 hours. A follow up tweet (shown below, right), said \"Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today.\" The tweet received more than 16,000 retweets and 43,000 likes. Twitter published a Moments page about Musk's tweets.[23][24][25]\n\nMedia Coverage\nSeveral media outlets covered Trump's potential withdrawal from the Paris agreement, including The New York Times, CNN,[7] Politico[8] and more, and Twitter published a Moments[9] page about the news.

Twitter user @jonathanvswan[21] posted a picture (shown below) of the band to Twitter with the caption: \"Celebratory mood in the White House Rose Garden for Paris announcement. A jazz band is playing.\" The post received more than 790 retweets and 1,600 likes within 24 hours.\n\n\nShortly after, people started comparing the band to the infamous band who played as the Titanic sunk. One Twitter user, @darth, tweeted a picture of the band submerged in water and Sean Spicer hiding behind a bush (shown below, left). The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours. Another, @GenGriebe posted a gif of the band in the film Titanic with the caption \"Another live shot of the band playing in the Rose Garden\" (shown below, right).\n\nOn June 1st, Twitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to the band.[2",

    "reasoning": "The meme depicts a structure (likely representing the White House) isolated in a body of water, suggesting a withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and the construction of a wall. This imagery metaphorically communicates the idea of isolationism in climate policy, emphasizing a rejection of international cooperation on climate issues. The other options either contradict the meme's message or do not relate to its core theme of withdrawal and isolation. Document ID 0 discusses the context of international agreements, which is relevant to understanding the overall theme, while the other documents focus on racial stereotypes and do not apply here. \n\nThus, the correct answer is A) Isolationism in climate policy.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal_15\" suggests a focus on climate policy, specifically the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement.

Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall.

This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.

    "reasoning": "The context of the meme involves the Paris Climate Agreement withdrawal, which is a significant political decision impacting climate change policy. The image of a building with a statue of a man likely symbolizes a political figure or a government institution, linking it to the theme of political decisions affecting climate policy. Document 0 does not directly reference the Paris Climate Agreement but suggests a cultural interpretation of racial themes, which is not applicable here. The other documents focus on racial and ethnic stereotypes, which do not relate to climate change.

This encourages the audience to think critically about the implications of such decisions and their impact on climate change and society. Document 0 discusses the false claims about racial stereotypes, which is not relevant to this meme's context. Document 1 discusses the 'Triple Heritage Theory', which is also unrelated. Document 3 mentions a different meme format that deals with cultural stereotypes, which is not pertinent here.

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

    "reasoning": "The meme depicts a building, likely symbolizing political authority, surrounded by water, illustrating the consequences of withdrawing from the Paris Accord and building a wall. This use of satire serves to provoke critical thinking about the implications of such political actions, making option B the most relevant.

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement. Twitter user @MissEllieMae[3] tweeted, \"In 100 years, Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement will be considered the seismic event.

Citing an article in The New York Times,[4] Twitter user @BraddJaffy[5] tweeted \"'it is now far more likely that we will breach the danger limit.'\" The tweet (shown below, right) garnered more than 580 retweets and 700 likes.\n\nRadio personality and author Hugh Hewitt tweeted[6] his approval of the withdrawal from the agreement. In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action. Many online noted the aggressive tone that they were now taking due to the withdrawal. Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad! Greenpace\" on the U.S. Embassy in Germany. Within five hours, the post (shown below) had received more than 58,600 points (69% upvoted) and 2,800 comments.[30]\n\nElon Musk\nFollowing rumors that the President would be withdrawing, Tesla-founder Elon Musk tweeted a response stating that he advised the president to stay.[11] He tweeted, \"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain.\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 4,800 retweets and 16,000 likes in about an hour. When asked what he would do if the U.S. withdraws, he tweeted, \"Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.\"[12] Twitter published a Moments[10] page regarding Musk's response to Trump's planned withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal announcement Musk announced that he would be leaving the \"presidential council.\" In his first Tweet on the subject, he said, \"Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 200,000 retweets and 460,000 likes in less than 24 hours.

Twitter published a Moments page about Musk's tweets.[23][24][25]\n\nMedia Coverage\nSeveral media outlets covered Trump's potential withdrawal from the Paris agreement, including The New York Times, CNN,[7] Politico[8] and more, and Twitter published a Moments[9] page about the news.

Twitter user @jonathanvswan[21] posted a picture (shown below) of the band to Twitter with the caption: \"Celebratory mood in the White House Rose Garden for Paris announcement. A jazz band is playing.\" The post received more than 790 retweets and 1,600 likes within 24 hours.\n\n\nShortly after, people started comparing the band to the infamous band who played as the Titanic sunk. One Twitter user, @darth, tweeted a picture of the band submerged in water and Sean Spicer hiding behind a bush (shown below, left). The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours. Another, @GenGriebe posted a gif of the band in the film Titanic with the caption \"Another live shot of the band playing in the Rose Garden\" (shown below, right).\n\nOn June 1st, Twitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to the band.[2",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action.

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

    "reasoning": "The meme depicts a humorous but critical take on the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, suggesting that merely building barriers (walls) will not solve the global issue of climate change. This aligns with option B, which critiques the ineffectiveness of national borders in addressing such a global problem. The other options do not correctly reflect the meme's satire; they either promote false narratives or do not address the core issue of climate change. The provided documents do not explicitly discuss the meme's context, but the critique of ineffective solutions aligns with the general themes found in discussions about climate agreements and borders. \n\nThus, the most relevant interpretation of the social commentary is option B.",

He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days.

This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

This aligns with the idea of critiquing the irony of addressing climate issues while still engaging in conflicts, which reflects a societal commentary on priorities. The oracle documents do not directly discuss this specific meme but provide context about the misuse of information in memes that influence public perception, such as the 'Global Race Maps' and 'Cultural Inversion' memes (Documents 1, 2).

    "reasoning": "The meme portrays a scenario where a figure resembling a former president engages in a conversation about building a wall, which metaphorically suggests a barrier against international cooperation, particularly regarding climate agreements. This aligns closely with option B, as it reflects a dismissive attitude towards such agreements and emphasizes the USA's perceived dominance in the global arena. The other options do not accurately capture the essence of the meme or its implications regarding power dynamics. None of the documents provided directly reference the meme, but the underlying themes of power, control, and international relations can be inferred.",

    "reasoning": "The meme depicts a man holding a sign saying \"stop the war,\" which could be interpreted as a critique of the ongoing conflicts surrounding climate agreements like the Paris Climate Accord. This aligns with option B, which highlights the conflict between economic interests (represented by the industrial imagery) and the responsibilities toward environmental protection. The other options do not directly relate to the meme's message about power dynamics in climate discourse. The documents provided do not specifically address this meme, but the general theme of power dynamics and social status in the context of environmental issues can be inferred. Hence, the correct answer is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

    "reasoning": "The image of a man holding a sign that says \"stop the war\" contrasts with the context of the Paris Climate Agreement withdrawal, suggesting a message of advocating for peace, particularly in the context of global issues like climate change. Document 1 discusses the incorrect portrayal of social issues but does not relate directly to the peace theme, while the other documents focus on racial identity and stereotypes. Therefore, option A is the most relevant as it aligns the visual message of stopping war with a broader call for peace, including in environmental contexts.",

    "reasoning": "The meme title suggests a connection to the Paris Climate Agreement, which relates to global discussions on climate action and social conflicts. The image caption, \"stop the war,\" indicates a focus on peace, which can encourage critical thinking about the impact of conflict on climate issues. Hence, option B is relevant as it reflects a proactive stance on peace in relation to addressing climate change. The other options (A, C, and D) do not connect directly to the theme of the meme or the message being conveyed through the image, making them distractors. Therefore, B is the best choice as it promotes critical reflection on the relationship between war and climate action.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

    "reasoning": "The meme specifically critiques the Paris Climate Agreement by contrasting the emissions of the U.S., China, and India before and after the agreement, implying that the treaty may not effectively help the environment, particularly highlighting the differences between developed and developing nations. This aligns with option B, which discusses the perceived hypocrisy in environmental commitments. The other options do not directly relate to the content or context of the meme.

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement. Twitter user @MissEllieMae[3] tweeted, \"In 100 years, Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement will be considered the seismic event.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action.

Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

Within five hours, the post (shown below) had received more than 58,600 points (69% upvoted) and 2,800 comments.[30]\n\nElon Musk\nFollowing rumors that the President would be withdrawing, Tesla-founder Elon Musk tweeted a response stating that he advised the president to stay.[11] He tweeted, \"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain.\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 4,800 retweets and 16,000 likes in about an hour. When asked what he would do if the U.S. withdraws, he tweeted, \"Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.\"[12] Twitter published a Moments[10] page regarding Musk's response to Trump's planned withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal announcement Musk announced that he would be leaving the \"presidential council.\" In his first Tweet on the subject, he said, \"Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 200,000 retweets and 460,000 likes in less than 24 hours. A follow up tweet (shown below, right), said \"Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today.\" The tweet received more than 16,000 retweets and 43,000 likes. Twitter published a Moments page about Musk's tweets.[23][24][25]\n\nMedia Coverage\nSeveral media outlets covered Trump's potential withdrawal from the Paris agreement, including The New York Times, CNN,[7] Politico[8] and more, and Twitter published a Moments[9] page about the news.

Twitter user @jonathanvswan[21] posted a picture (shown below) of the band to Twitter with the caption: \"Celebratory mood in the White House Rose Garden for Paris announcement. A jazz band is playing.\" The post received more than 790 retweets and 1,600 likes within 24 hours.\n\n\nShortly after, people started comparing the band to the infamous band who played as the Titanic sunk. One Twitter user, @darth, tweeted a picture of the band submerged in water and Sean Spicer hiding behind a bush (shown below, left). The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours.

    "reasoning": "The meme critiques the effectiveness of the Paris Climate Agreement by comparing the pollution levels of the U.S., China, and India before and after the treaty, suggesting that the agreement does not significantly help the environment. This aligns with option B, which highlights the perceived hypocrisy in how developed countries (like the U.S.) and developing countries (like China and India) are portrayed in terms of their pollution contributions. The other options do not accurately reflect the meme's message. The oracle documents do not specifically address the Paris Climate Agreement but hint at the broader theme of misinformation and stereotypes, which can relate indirectly to the critique shown in the meme. However, they are not directly relevant to interpreting the specific message of this meme. Thus, option B is the best fit.",

    "reasoning": "The meme visually compares the emissions before and after the Paris Climate Agreement for the U.S., China, and India, suggesting a perception that the agreement is ineffective in truly reducing emissions. This aligns with option B, which highlights a criticism of the agreement's effectiveness. The other options either misinterpret the meme's intent or present a stance not supported by the visual evidence. No documents explicitly address the meme's context, but the general understanding of environmental discourse helps identify the correct interpretation.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

    "reasoning": "The meme uses irony and satire to critique the effectiveness of the Paris Climate Agreement by showing that while it portrays the U.S. as making progress, other countries like China and India are depicted as continuing or even increasing pollution. This aligns with option B, as it implies that the U.S. faces undue criticism compared to other nations that are not shown to change their pollution levels.

    "reasoning": "The humor in the meme likely critiques the notion of withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, juxtaposing this serious political issue with a light-hearted image of food. The most relevant document here is the context provided by the meme title itself, which refers to a significant international agreement aimed at combating climate change. The options A, C, and D don't directly address the irony of using food to comment on a serious political decision, while option B effectively captures that irony. Thus, option B is the correct answer as it highlights the absurdity of thinking that withdrawing from such an agreement would lead to positive outcomes in agriculture or food diversity.",

He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall.

This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

    "reasoning": "The meme's title, \"paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal,\" suggests a focus on environmental issues and political decisions related to climate agreements. The image caption showing a variety of foods may imply a discussion about cultural diversity or globalization, reflecting on how these issues intersect with food practices and identities. Document 0 (\"Ancestry Challenge\" memes) mentions racial identity and cultural aspects but does not directly relate to food or climate agreements. Document 1 (\"Cross-Cultural IQ\") and Document 3 (\"Genetic Character\") focus on race and intelligence or personality, which are not relevant here. Document 4 (\"Triple Heritage Theory\") talks about cultural stereotypes but does not link to climate or food identity.

    "reasoning": "The meme depicts the emissions of different countries before and after the Paris Climate Treaty, visually suggesting that the treaty does not significantly impact emissions levels. This aligns with option A, which correctly identifies the meme's critical perspective on the effectiveness of the Paris Agreement. The other options refer to unrelated concepts: option B discusses linguistic variations (document 0), option C addresses racial categorization (document 1), and option D involves fictional statistics about countries (document 4). Therefore, the most relevant document for understanding the meme's message is related to its focus on emissions and the effectiveness of international climate agreements.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall.

This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

    "reasoning": "The meme's caption and collage suggest a connection between food and the implications of the Paris Climate Agreement withdrawal. Given that the documents provided do not directly discuss food in relation to climate policies or the Paris Agreement, the relevant analysis rests on understanding how visual elements (food) might comment on political themes (climate agreement). Option A suggests a direct connection to climate change and food diversity, which aligns with the expected implications of climate policy.

    "question_with_options": "**Multiple-Choice Question:**\n\nWhat is the primary message conveyed by the \"Paris Climate Treaty\" meme in terms of environmental policy?\n\nA) It suggests that international agreements significantly reduce pollution levels worldwide.\n\nB) It critiques the effectiveness of the Paris Climate Agreement by showing a lack of substantial environmental improvement in the U.S., China, and India.\n\nC) It supports the Paris Climate Agreement as a necessary step towards global environmental protection.\n\nD) It highlights the cooperation between nations in addressing climate change.\n\n**Answer: B**",
    "reasoning": "The meme visually contrasts the pollution levels before and after the Paris Climate Treaty for the U.S., China, and India, indicating that despite the agreement, there is little to no positive change in environmental conditions. This aligns with the critique that international agreements may not lead to substantial results, which is the core message of the meme. None of the other options accurately reflect the meme's intent. The provided documents (especially those about the incorrect mapping of speech and cultural elements) do not directly inform the analysis of this meme, making them irrelevant. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement. Twitter user @MissEllieMae[3] tweeted, \"In 100 years, Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement will be considered the seismic event. This election will be a footnote.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 1,200 retweets and 2,900 likes in eight hours. Citing an article in The New York Times,[4] Twitter user @BraddJaffy[5] tweeted \"'it is now far more likely that we will breach the danger limit.'\" The tweet (shown below, right) garnered more than 580 retweets and 700 likes.\n\nRadio personality and author Hugh Hewitt tweeted[6] his approval of the withdrawal from the agreement. In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action. Many online noted the aggressive tone that they were now taking due to the withdrawal. Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad! Greenpace\" on the U.S. Embassy in Germany. Within five hours, the post (shown below) had received more than 58,600 points (69% upvoted) and 2,800 comments.[30]\n\nElon Musk\nFollowing rumors that the President would be withdrawing, Tesla-founder Elon Musk tweeted a response stating that he advised the president to stay.[11] He tweeted, \"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain.\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 4,800 retweets and 16,000 likes in about an hour. When asked what he would do if the U.S. withdraws, he tweeted, \"Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.\"[12] Twitter published a Moments[10] page regarding Musk's response to Trump's planned withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal announcement Musk announced that he would be leaving the \"presidential council.\" In his first Tweet on the subject, he said, \"Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 200,000 retweets and 460,000 likes in less than 24 hours. A follow up tweet (shown below, right), said \"Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today.\" The tweet received more than 16,000 retweets and 43,000 likes. Twitter published a Moments page about Musk's tweets.[23][24][25]\n\nMedia Coverage\nSeveral media outlets covered Trump's potential withdrawal from the Paris agreement, including The New York Times, CNN,[7] Politico[8] and more, and Twitter published a Moments[9] page about the news.

Twitter user @jonathanvswan[21] posted a picture (shown below) of the band to Twitter with the caption: \"Celebratory mood in the White House Rose Garden for Paris announcement. A jazz band is playing.\" The post received more than 790 retweets and 1,600 likes within 24 hours.\n\n\nShortly after, people started comparing the band to the infamous band who played as the Titanic sunk. One Twitter user, @darth, tweeted a picture of the band submerged in water and Sean Spicer hiding behind a bush (shown below, left). The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours. Another, @GenGriebe posted a gif of the band in the film Titanic with the caption \"Another live shot of the band playing in the Rose Garden\" (shown below, right).\n\nOn June 1st, Twitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to the band.[2",

    "reasoning": "The meme’s title relates to the \"Paris Climate Agreement,\" which is a significant international effort to combat climate change. However, the image caption presents a collage of various types of food, which can imply a connection between climate policies and food diversity. While the documents provided do not directly discuss the relationship between climate agreements and food diversity, they do inform us about the potential manipulation of information (like the exaggeration in the 'Ethnic Forecast' meme). The absence of direct evidence in the documents regarding food diversity means one must infer from the juxtaposition of the meme’s title and the diverse food imagery.\n\nAmong the options, A suggests a positive outcome from withdrawal, which may be implied by the diversity shown, while B suggests a negative impact, which aligns with a common criticism of withdrawal from environmental agreements. C dismisses any relationship, which doesn't align with the context presented by the meme. D suggests a positive relationship, which is not explicitly supported by the meme's premise.\n\nGiven the context of misunderstanding related to the Paris Agreement and the focus on food diversity, the most fitting option seems to be B, as it reflects the critique often associated with withdrawing from climate agreements, implying a detrimental effect on food production. \n\nUltimately, the correct interpretation aligns with a viewpoint that suggests a negative impact of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on food diversity.",

    "reasoning": "The meme visually contrasts the emissions of the U.S., China, and India before and after the Paris Climate Agreement, with a caption questioning its effectiveness. This aligns with the viewpoint presented in option B, as it suggests that despite the agreement, there is no noticeable improvement in emissions. The documents provided do not directly relate to this meme, as they focus on racial stereotypes and cultural memes rather than environmental issues.

    "reasoning": "The meme's content and context, particularly the mention of the Paris Climate Agreement withdrawal, suggest it reflects a cultural moment marked by political and environmental discourse. This topic gained significant attention during the late 2010s, particularly impacting Millennial and Gen Z perspectives on climate issues. However, the formal attire of a man in a suit and tie typically aligns more with professional and political contexts that are often associated with the Baby Boomer Generation, who have historically held positions of power during the implementation of such policies. \n\nWhile documents 0 through 4 address various memes and their implications on social and racial issues, they do not directly pertain to the climate change or political discourse reflected in the meme in question. Therefore, they are not relevant to determining the culture reflected in the meme. \n\nGiven the political nature and formality suggested by the attire, the most fitting answer is B) Baby Boomer Generation, as they played a significant role in the political decisions surrounding agreements like the Paris Accord.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days.

Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall.

He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below).

    "reasoning": "The meme's title suggests a focus on the Paris Climate Agreement and its withdrawal, which directly relates to social conflicts around climate change policy. The image of a man in a suit and tie typically symbolizes authority, leadership, or political commentary. In this case, it likely represents the disconnection or indifference of political figures toward climate issues, particularly when they withdraw from international agreements designed to combat climate change. None of the documents provided directly discuss the Paris Agreement, but the implication of political figures in the image aligns best with option A. The other options do not fit the context of withdrawal or the critique implied by the image. Therefore, the most appropriate interpretation is that it symbolizes the indifference of political leaders toward climate agreements.",

    "reasoning": "To analyze the irony in the meme, we can infer that the situation surrounding the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement is unexpected and contrasts with the anticipated responsibility of a global leader in addressing climate issues. The meme highlights the contradiction between the action of withdrawing and the global expectation of commitment to climate agreements. Thus, situational irony is most relevant here. \n\nThe document that discusses the Paris Climate Agreement is not explicitly provided, but the context around political decisions related to climate reflects the essence of the situation being ironic. Other documents primarily focus on memes related to race and do not address the climate issue directly, making them less relevant for this question. \n\nTherefore, the most suitable answer is B, as it encapsulates the irony of the situation.",

    "question_with_options": "### Multiple-Choice Question\n\nWhat kind of irony is revealed in the meme titled \"paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal_18\"?\n\nA) Situational irony where the expected outcome is drastically different from the actual outcome.\n\nB) Verbal irony where the words used imply a meaning opposite to their literal meaning.\n\nC) Dramatic irony where the audience knows more about a situation than the characters involved.\n\nD) Cosmic irony where fate or a deity manipulates events to create unfortunate outcomes.\n\n### Answer and Reasoning",
    "reasoning": "The meme's context revolves around the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, which is a significant political action that has global environmental implications. The title suggests a serious topic, while the image and caption may convey a sense of levity or mockery about the situation. This aligns with situational irony (Option A), as the expectation of serious environmental policy is contrasted with a portrayal that could suggest indifference or humor regarding the consequences.\n\nThe provided documents do not explicitly relate to the meme, but they provide a background on the type of memes that have circulated regarding societal and political issues. However, none of the documents directly address the concept of irony related to climate agreements, making it necessary to analyze the irony based on the meme itself. \n\nThus, the most fitting answer is situational irony, as it captures the unexpected juxtaposition of serious political decisions with a tone that may undermine their importance.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

Many online noted the aggressive tone that they were now taking due to the withdrawal. Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad! Greenpace\" on the U.S. Embassy in Germany. Within five hours, the post (shown below) had received more than 58,600 points (69% upvoted) and 2,800 comments.[30]\n\nElon Musk\nFollowing rumors that the President would be withdrawing, Tesla-founder Elon Musk tweeted a response stating that he advised the president to stay.[11] He tweeted, \"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain.\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 4,800 retweets and 16,000 likes in about an hour.

    "reasoning": "The key to understanding the structural inequality exposed by the meme lies in recognizing how political decisions, such as the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, are often made by figures of authority, typically depicted in formal attire (like the man in a suit and tie). This visual representation suggests a disconnect between these leaders and the societal impacts of their decisions on the global community, particularly regarding climate change. Thus, option D directly addresses this disparity in responsibility and accountability. The other options (A, B, and C) relate to racial identity and stereotypes, which do not pertain to the theme of climate agreements and political leadership. Therefore, the most relevant option is D.",

Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning.

    "reasoning": "The meme's caption references the \"Paris Climate Agreement withdrawal,\" indicating a political context. Document 0 discusses the creation of misleading memes related to racial harmony indexes, which is not relevant to understanding the political implications of the Paris Climate Agreement. However, none of the documents directly address the specific context of climate agreements or political figures involved in them.

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours.

    "reasoning": "The context of the meme relates to the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, which was a significant political move by then-President Trump that resonated with nationalist sentiments and anti-globalization rhetoric. This aligns with document references that highlight how manipulated statistics and misinformation can influence public perception, although none of the distractor documents directly address the climate agreement.

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action.

Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

    "reasoning": "The meme title suggests a connection to the Paris Climate Agreement and its withdrawal, which implies a critique of political decisions regarding environmental policies. Document references do not directly pertain to the meme's focus on climate agreements. However, the mention of political themes in the title indicates that option B, which addresses the criticism of withdrawing from global climate agreements, aligns most closely with the message of the meme. Other options (A, C, D) refer to unrelated themes like racial diversity, intelligence, and technology, which do not connect to the climate topic. Thus, B is the most relevant and accurate interpretation of the meme's social message.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** How does the meme titled \"paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal_19\" utilize satire to comment on political attitudes towards climate change?\n\nA) By depicting a political figure who is indifferent to climate issues.  \nB) By presenting exaggerated claims about climate change impacts.  \nC) By using humor to trivialize the significance of international agreements.  \nD) By suggesting that climate change is a hoax invented by scientists.",
    "reasoning": "The correct answer is A) By depicting a political figure who is indifferent to climate issues. The meme’s title references the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, which suggests a lack of seriousness towards climate change—a sentiment that can be satirically portrayed through an image of a man in a suit, typically representing authority and decision-making. This aligns with the idea that political figures often express indifference to pressing issues like climate change, thus utilizing satire effectively. The other options do not directly relate to the specific satirical elements depicted in the meme. The documents provided do not directly discuss the meme in question, as they focus on race-related memes and their false claims, making them less relevant to understanding the satire in the climate change context. Therefore, the reasoning leads us to option A as the most fitting choice.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time.

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall.

This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

    "reasoning": "The meme summarizes Trump's planned withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, presenting a critical view of this decision. The combination of text and imagery likely conveys a negative stance on environmental policy, which aligns with option B. The other options either do not reflect the critical tone of the meme or misinterpret its message.

    "reasoning": "Option A is the most relevant, as it highlights the interaction between the authoritative visual of a man in a suit and the politically charged caption about withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement. The documents do not directly address this meme, but they provide context on the use of imagery in political discourse. Option B, while discussing design, does not connect effectively to the content of the meme. Option C incorrectly relates historical context to a contemporary issue, and option D is irrelevant as it diverges from the central theme of climate policy. Therefore, A is the best choice.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change.

    "reasoning": "The meme's title refers to the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, which was a significant political move that has been associated with corporate interests and skepticism towards climate action. The image of a man in a suit and tie often symbolizes authority or corporate presence, suggesting a connection to business interests. This context aligns with the message that the man may represent corporate interests that are opposed to climate action (Option B). The other options do not align with the cultural implications of the withdrawal from the climate agreement, making them less relevant. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the meme is that it critiques the corporate stance against climate initiatives.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action.

Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

    "reasoning": "The relevant document for understanding this meme is the context of the Paris Climate Agreement, which implies a contradiction between the leaders' discussions about climate action and the U.S.'s decision to withdraw from the agreement. The other documents focus on race-related memes and do not pertain to climate agreements, making them distractors. Therefore, option B accurately captures the irony of the situation depicted in the meme.",

    "reasoning": "The meme depicts a gathering of world leaders, emphasizing the contrast between their collective support for the Paris Climate Agreement and the tweet from Donald Trump indicating his indecision about the agreement. This highlights the irony of a leader contemplating withdrawal from a global consensus on climate action. Document references are not particularly relevant to the meme's context as none of the provided documents directly address the Paris Climate Agreement. However, the general theme of misinformation and contradiction present in the documents reflects the broader context of the meme. The best answer is A, as it directly addresses the contradiction between the leaders' unity and Trump's stance.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false.

    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme's context, we can infer that the image caption describes a man in a suit next to a group of people, likely indicating a power dynamic where the man represents authority or decision-making in climate policy. This aligns with structural inequalities, particularly in the context of climate change, where wealthier nations (often in the Global North) have historically contributed more to greenhouse gas emissions and have greater resources to address climate issues, compared to developing nations in the Global South. Thus, option D, which reflects the Global North-South divide in climate responsibilities, is the most relevant and accurate interpretation of the inequality portrayed in the meme. The other options do not directly connect to the context of climate policy illustrated by the meme. The documents provided do not specifically address climate policy or structural inequalities related to it, making option D the best choice based on its implications.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement. Redditor Whoshabooboo posted the article to the /r/politics subreddit, receiving more than 32,900 points (88% upvoted) and 2,600 comments.[13] There were also threads on /r/The_Donald, which received more than 9,000 points (81% upvoted) and 1,200 comments.[14] Several other threads in /r/politics received more than 1,000 points within eight hours of posting.[15][16]\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Weather.com's covered their home page in pointed articles about the effects of climate change and the importance of action. Many online noted the aggressive tone that they were now taking due to the withdrawal. Twitter user @whynotanna tweeted a picture of the home page with the caption \"holy shit, weather.com home page right now.\" The tweet received more than 27,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.[26]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document Weather.com's home page and the reaction to it.[27]\nIn his speech, Trump said, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" This statement led many from Pittsburgh to criticize the President. The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

When asked what he would do if the U.S. withdraws, he tweeted, \"Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.\"[12] Twitter published a Moments[10] page regarding Musk's response to Trump's planned withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal announcement Musk announced that he would be leaving the \"presidential council.\" In his first Tweet on the subject, he said, \"Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 200,000 retweets and 460,000 likes in less than 24 hours.

Twitter published a Moments page about Musk's tweets.[23][24][25]\n\nMedia Coverage\nSeveral media outlets covered Trump's potential withdrawal from the Paris agreement, including The New York Times, CNN,[7] Politico[8] and more, and Twitter published a Moments[9] page about the news.

The tweet received more than 680 retweets and 2,100 likes within 24 hours.

    "reasoning": "The correct answer is A because the image of a man in a suit typically represents authority or leadership, which aligns with discussions on political decisions like the Paris Climate Agreement and its potential impacts on various communities, including racial dynamics. Document 2 discusses the 'Racial Harmony Quotient,' which is related but does not directly connect to the image's context of climate policy. Document 0 discusses the 'Triple Heritage Theory,' which is about cultural misrepresentation rather than the political implications of climate policies. Document 4 relates to the 'Global Race Maps,' but it does not address the theme of political authority in climate discussions. Thus, option A best captures the connection between the image and the meme's themes.",

    "oracle_doc": "paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal\n\nOverview\nParis Climate Agreement Withdrawal refers to President Donald Trump announcing plans to withdraw the United States from a United Nations plan to fight climate change by 2020.\n\nBackground\nOn April 22nd, 2016, 175 world leaders met at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to sign the Paris Accord, an agreement for global action in the fight against climate change. Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below). He said that he wanted to renegotiate the \"deal\" because the U.S. had been treated unfairly.[20]\n\nReaction\nFollowing Trump's announcement to leave the Paris agreement, countries around the world announced their intention to follow through on their commitment to reducing the effects of climate change. Several major cities lit landmarks green in support of the Paris Agreement, including the World Trade Center in New York City and Paris' City Hall. Cities and Stated around the U.S. launched the \"Cimate Alliance\" to uphold the U.S.'s commitment to the agreement.[35]\n\nThe President of France Emmanuel Macron made a statement stating that they would continue to work against the effects of climate change to \"make the planet great again.\" Many saw his sentiment, \"make the planet great again,\" as direct response to President Trump, who is known for saying \"Make America Great Again.\":\\/memes/make-america-great-again Several news outlets covered Macron's response, including The Daily Dot,[31]\nVox,[32] Washington Post,[33] and more.\n\nThat day, The Washington Post fact checked President Trump's speech, pointing out several statements that proved to be false, including the notion that the U.S. needed to renegotiate the \"deal.\" The U.S., as per the treaty, can alter its commitment at any time. This also means that his statement, “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020” was also false. Because every country sets their own goals for the accord, there is nothing stopping any country from building coal plants. However, following the Agreement signing, China announced that it canceled plans to build 100 coal-fired plants.[34]\n\nOnline Reaction\nFollowing the reports, users on Twitter began discussing the fallout and potential dangers of U.S. withdrawal of the Agreement.

In two tweets, he said, \"Bravo to @realDonaldTrump if he withdraws from #ParisAgreement Like the #irandeal both are vast overreachs of executive authority, cutting out Congress which ought to have the final say on such far reaching treaties and which @POTUS44 ignored in both cases.\"\n\nOn Reddit, several threads were started to discuss the potential withdrawal. The most popular concerned New York City mayor Bill De Blasio, who said the city would uphold the agreement.

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said on Twitter, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" The tweet received more than 37,000 retweets and 77,000 likes.[28]\n\nTwitter published a Moments page to document the reaction to Trump's comment on Pittsburgh and its citizens.[29]\n\nOn June 2nd, Redditor EccentricRichAndSexy posted a picture of a stencil of Donald Trump's silhouette and the caption \"#TotalLoser, so sad!

    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme's viewpoint on the Paris Climate Agreement, we need to consider the context provided by the documents. Document 0 discusses the 'Triple Heritage Theory' and how it misrepresents racial stereotypes, which is unrelated to climate change. Document 1 talks about viral race memes and their inaccuracies, again not relevant. Document 2 mentions the 'Cultural Inversion' meme format, which is focused on racial stereotypes rather than environmental issues. Document 3 discusses the 'Ethnic Forecast' meme, which also does not pertain to the climate agreement. Document 4 addresses the 'Ethnic Expression Scale,' which is irrelevant as well.\n\nNone of the provided documents directly relate to the Paris Climate Agreement or its withdrawal.

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What viewpoint does the meme regarding the Paris Climate Agreement withdrawal convey about international climate cooperation?\n\n**Options:**\nA) It suggests that the United States prioritizes its own interests over global climate agreements.\nB) It indicates that all countries are united in their commitment to the Paris Agreement.\nC) It implies that climate change is not a significant issue for world leaders.\nD) It portrays the Paris Agreement as successful and universally supported by all nations.",
    "reasoning": "The meme features a prominent figure, Donald Trump, suggesting a decision on the Paris Accord, which indicates a potential withdrawal from international cooperation on climate issues. This aligns with the viewpoint that the U.S. may prioritize its own interests, as Trump's administration was known for skepticism towards international agreements, including the Paris Agreement. The other options either misrepresent the context or provide an overly optimistic view of international cooperation that is not supported by the meme or the context surrounding the discussion of the Paris Agreement. Therefore, the relevant document is the meme itself, which illustrates a critical perspective on U.S. involvement in global climate efforts.",

Drafted in 2015, the Paris agreement set forth a plan for each country to set targets for reducing their contribution to climate change. Every country has a different set of goals, which can be altered as needed. The plan was to slowly decrease the speed of climate change.[1]\n\nDevelopment\nOn May 31st, 2017, the news website Axios[2] tweeted, \"BREAKING: President Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\" The tweet received more than 5,500 retweets and 2,800 likes in less than eight hours.\n\nSeveral hours later, President Trump addressed the rumors in a tweet that morning. He said, \"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 11,000 retweets and 51,300 likes.On June 1st, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord at press conference in the White House rose garden (shown below).
