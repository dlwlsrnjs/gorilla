Document 1 provides a thorough explanation of the term \"Karen,\" including its origins and cultural significance, making it the relevant oracle document for understanding this meme. The other documents (0, 2, 3) do not provide relevant information. Thus, option B is the correct answer.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme title \"karen_2\" directly refers to the cultural stereotype of \"Karen,\" which typically describes a person (often a woman) who exhibits entitled behavior, especially towards service workers. The image caption \"a man is talking on a cell phone\" does not provide a strong contextual clue but does hint at modern societal behaviors, which could tie into the stereotype. Thus, option B is the most relevant answer as it directly references the cultural phenomenon associated with the term \"Karen.\" The other options, while relevant to broader societal themes, do not specifically connect to the \"Karen\" stereotype. The distractor documents do not provide any relevant insights into the meme's context.",
    "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: B",
    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"karens_2\" references the cultural phenomenon surrounding \"Karen\" memes, which often critique entitled behavior, particularly among certain demographics. The social groups in opposition here primarily consist of individuals who create or enjoy these memes, often targeting those who exhibit entitled behavior (often represented by the stereotype of a \"Karen\"). Therefore, option B, which identifies individuals named Karen against meme creators, is the most relevant because it highlights the social conflict represented in the meme. The distractor documents provided do not contain any relevant context that could help resolve the question, as they are generic and do not discuss the \"Karen\" phenomenon or its implications. Hence, the correct answer is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times.

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme plays on the concept of \"Karen\" as a stereotype often associated with entitled behavior, typically attributed to a specific social demographic. The caption refers to an inability to ignore \"Karen memes,\" suggesting a divide between those who find them humorous or relevant (often the younger or more progressive demographic) and those who may take offense or find them derogatory (often older or more traditional audiences). Thus, the most fitting opposition is between individuals advocating for social justice and those who resist change (Option A).

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme \"One does not simply ignore Karen memes\" humorously addresses the cultural phenomenon of \"Karens,\" often associated with entitlement. When analyzing the image caption, \"A man is talking on a cell phone,\" it lacks any reference to the humorous context of \"Karens.\" Therefore, when viewed without the image, the text alone becomes mundane and does not convey the intended humor of the meme. The relevant document for understanding the humor in the meme is the image itself, while the provided documents (0, 1, 2, 3) are distractors and don't contribute meaningfully to this analysis.

    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"karen_2\" likely addresses a social issue related to the behavior or attitude of people, particularly those often referred to as \"Karens,\" who may be seen as overly demanding or entitled in public settings. The image caption states that \"a man is talking on a cell phone,\" which could imply a critique of social etiquette in public spaces, as it suggests a lack of awareness or consideration for those around him. Among the documents provided, none explicitly detail this viewpoint, but they do not contradict it either.

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004.

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "This meme features a woman (often referred to as a \"Karen\") expressing dissatisfaction over not being able to use a coupon, juxtaposed with a serious scenario involving the coronavirus. The humor lies in the absurdity of wanting to speak to the \"manager of the coronavirus,\" highlighting a stereotypical behavior associated with entitlement and complaints. The relevant document would focus on the perception of this social group and their actions, which aligns with option C regarding \"Karen\" stereotypes.

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The image caption suggests that the woman is holding a sign, which typically indicates a message or a stance on an issue. Given the context of the term \"Karen\" as described in Document 1, where \"Karen\" is associated with negative behaviors and entitlement, it is reasonable to interpret that the meme may be critiquing the stereotypical behavior associated with \"Karens.\" The other options do not align with the context provided in Document 1, which focuses on the social implications of the Karen stereotype.

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen.

He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme features a character commonly associated with the \"Karen\" stereotype, known for her entitled behavior and demands, especially in frustrating situations. Document 1 discusses how \"Karen\" is often depicted as an annoying woman, particularly in contexts where she is perceived as creating social conflict, such as demanding to speak to managers in inappropriate situations. The text highlights her entitlement, particularly in public settings, which aligns with the meme's depiction of her complaining about not being accepted in a crisis. Thus, the most relevant option reflecting this stereotype and the ensuing social conflict is B) The stereotype of entitled behavior during a crisis. Options A, C, and D do not directly address the core issue of entitlement and conflict represented in the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "To understand the relationship between the image caption and the meme title \"karen_1\", we need to consider the context suggested by the keyword \"karen.\" Typically, this could refer to a stereotype of a woman (often depicted as entitled or demanding) who is complaining or protesting. The image caption describes a woman holding a sign, which aligns with the idea of someone making a statement or protesting, thus supporting option A. The other options (B, C, D) do not fit the suggested context of \"karen\" as they imply different scenarios that do not involve holding a sign for protest. However, the documents provided (all distractors) do not contain relevant information that would directly support or contradict this analysis. Therefore, option A is the most logical conclusion based on the meme's title and image caption.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

[1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The meme plays on the stereotype of “Karen” as a demanding person who often seeks to speak to a manager, suggesting a humorous take on the naming convention and societal expectations. This aligns most closely with option B, as it directly references the stereotype associated with the name \"Karen.\" The other options, while they touch on relevant themes, do not directly capture the essence of the meme. The provided documents do not contain relevant information to solve the question but serve as distractors. Thus, option B stands out as the correct interpretation.",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously addresses the stereotype of women named \"Karen\" who are perceived as entitled and demanding, often depicted as wanting to speak to a manager. The text plays on the idea that babies named \"Karen\" don't seem to exist in modern times and instead implies that those who do bear the name emerge as entitled adults. This aligns with option B, which accurately reflects the cultural stereotype associated with the name \"Karen.\" \n\nThe distractor documents (ID 0, 1, 2, 3) do not provide relevant information to understand the meme's message, as they are dummy texts without any connection to the stereotype or the content of the meme.

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

This suggests a critique of societal attitudes towards women, particularly those labeled as \"Karens,\" thus making option B (Ageism and stereotypes about middle-aged women) the most relevant answer.

When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The meme depicts a situation where individuals characterized as \"Karens\" are themselves complaining about similar behaviors from others, illustrating a common theme of hypocrisy. Document 2 provides context on the \"Karen\" meme phenomenon, explaining how the term is associated with entitled behavior and complaints, especially in public settings. Thus, the relevant interpretation of the meme aligns with option A, which highlights this hypocrisy.

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"karen_4\" includes an image caption that describes a woman and a man posing for a picture. The use of the term \"Karen\" typically symbolizes a stereotype of a person who exhibits entitled, demanding behavior, often in public settings. This context indicates that the meme likely comments on social conflict, particularly regarding the stereotype of 'Karens' in social interactions and how they are perceived in society. Therefore, option B, which describes a stereotypical representation of entitled behavior, is the most relevant interpretation of the meme. The other options, while they touch on aspects of social interactions or photography, do not directly relate to the theme of social conflict associated with the 'Karen' stereotype.

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme showcases a situation where a woman, referred to as \"Karen,\" is criticizing the crowded beach despite having driven 90 minutes to get there, which emphasizes the irony in her complaint. This aligns with the documented characteristics of \"Karen\" as an entitled figure who often expresses dissatisfaction in situations she contributes to, as described in Document 1. The options reflect various interpretations of the situation, but only option A accurately captures the contradiction presented in the meme. Options B, C, and D either do not relate to the meme or misrepresent its content.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"karen_4\" likely references the term \"Karen,\" which is often used to describe a stereotype of a certain type of woman perceived to be entitled or demanding, particularly in social situations. This suggests an examination of gender stereotypes, as the term encapsulates societal expectations and behaviors associated with women in authority or privilege. Among the documents provided, none directly address the content regarding \"Karen\" or gender stereotypes explicitly. However, the context of the meme implies that the structural inequality being highlighted relates to typical societal views on gender roles and expectations in social behavior. Therefore, option D, which refers to gender stereotypes in social behavior, closely aligns with the implications of the meme. The other options, while significant social issues, do not connect directly to the context of the meme. Thus, the most relevant answer is D.",

    "reasoning": "The meme title \"karen_4\" likely refers to a stereotype or common theme associated with individuals named Karen, particularly in the context of social conflicts. The image caption describes a woman and a man posing for a picture, which implies a neutral or positive interaction rather than a conflict. The most relevant option is A, as the title may imply that the woman is named Karen, connecting the title to the image. The other options either misinterpret the context (B and C) or dismiss any relationship (D) between the title and the image. Thus, option A is the best choice.",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004.

Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts.

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"
