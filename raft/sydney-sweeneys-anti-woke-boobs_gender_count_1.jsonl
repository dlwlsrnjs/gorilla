    "reasoning": "The meme \"Sydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs\" reflects contemporary culture of the 2020s, as it centers around current social discussions about \"wokeness\" and public figures, specifically referencing Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live in March 2024. The sentiments expressed in the meme, as well as the social media reactions documented in the first oracle document, indicate a reaction to modern cultural issues and beauty standards, which are characteristic of this current era. The second document about \"Racial Harmony Quotient\" memes is unrelated to the specific cultural context of the Sweeney meme. Therefore, the relevant document is Document 0, which discusses the meme's implications and the public's reaction.",

This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media.

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter.

Document 1 discusses a contemporary issue regarding Sydney Sweeney and the backlash against 'woke' culture, which is a significant cultural conversation in the Modern/Post-Modern Era. The meme plays on current debates surrounding beauty standards, social norms, and political correctness, reflecting the complexities of today's social climate. In contrast, the other options (Victorian Era, 1980s Pop Culture, and Renaissance) do not resonate with the themes of contemporary discussions on beauty and 'wokeness' as highlighted in Document 1.

The focus on social media interactions and the commentary surrounding them is specific to the current era.

    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\" discusses how Sydney Sweeney's appearance is interpreted as a challenge to \"woke\" culture, which targets social norms around beauty and attractiveness. Document 1 highlights the reaction to Sweeney's appearance as a commentary on wokeness, suggesting that her beauty is an affront to the ideals of inclusivity and equity that some associate with \"woke\" culture. This indicates a metaphorical conflict between beauty and political correctness, making option B the most relevant interpretation. Document 0 focuses on linguistic variations and does not pertain to the metaphor in the meme, serving as a distractor.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

The relevant document (Document 0) discusses how Sweeney's appearance sparked debate about beauty standards and wokeness, making option C particularly relevant as it encapsulates this commentary. The other options, while they may touch on relevant themes, do not directly connect to the meme's focus on Sweeney's beauty in relation to societal expectations of wokeness.

    "reasoning": "The meme references Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the discussions around it, particularly the claim that her beauty undermines \"wokeness.\" Document 0 provides context about how her appearance was interpreted by different social groups, especially conservatives, as a form of rebellion against woke culture. The humor arises from the exaggerated claims that beauty, as represented by Sweeney's cleavage, can \"kill\" woke culture, which is inherently absurd. Therefore, option B, which points to the absurdity of the claim that beauty can challenge social movements, aligns with the satirical nature of the meme. Options A and C, while related, do not capture the humor's essence as effectively as B. Option D misrepresents the meme's focus on beauty rather than a direct critique of wokeness itself. Thus, the best answer is B.",

This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media.

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter.

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "To analyze the social conflict represented in the meme, we refer primarily to Document 0, which discusses the backlash against Sydney Sweeney's appearance and how it is perceived by conservative commentators as a challenge to \"woke\" culture. The meme likely reflects the tension surrounding beauty standards and societal expectations, particularly in the context of how admiration for Sweeney’s looks is framed as anti-woke sentiment. \n\nOption A accurately captures this essence, as it highlights the celebration of beauty amidst criticisms of traditional attractiveness standards, which resonates with the sentiments expressed in Document 0. \n\nOption B, while relevant to social conflict, pertains to linguistic issues and is covered in Document 1, which is not connected to the context of the meme about Sydney Sweeney. \n\nOption C addresses artistic expression, but it does not directly relate to the specific discussion around Sweeney and \"wokeness.\" \n\nOption D could be seen as indirectly relevant, but it lacks the specificity of the beauty conflict highlighted in Document 0. \n\nThus, the best option that encapsulates the conflict depicted in the meme is A.",

    "reasoning": "The relevant document for understanding the meme is Document 1, which discusses how Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live sparked debates about wokeness and beauty. It highlights the sentiment that admiring Sweeney's attractiveness can be seen as a stance against wokeness. The image caption of a woman with a red face and a blue and white face likely represents conflicting views on beauty and social expectations. Therefore, option B correctly identifies the meme's commentary on the clash between traditional beauty standards and the ideals of wokeness, while the other options either misinterpret the meme's intent or ignore its cultural context.",

    "reasoning": "Option A is partially relevant as it discusses division, but it doesn’t fully capture the anti-woke sentiment. Option B aligns closely with the documents, especially Document 0, which discusses the admiration of Sweeney's beauty as a stance against wokeness. Document 0 highlights the discussions around beauty and \"wokeness,\" making this option the most coherent. Option C incorrectly suggests societal pressure as a main theme. Option D misinterprets the meme’s focus, as it doesn’t relate to racial authenticity but rather to beauty and societal debates. Thus, B is the best answer.",

    "reasoning": "To analyze the underlying bias in the meme, we can refer to Document 1, which discusses the context around Sydney Sweeney's appearance and how it has been interpreted in relation to wokeness. The document highlights the argument that admiring Sweeney's beauty is seen as a stance against wokeness, which signifies a belief that such admiration is politically charged. This aligns with option B, which points out that admiration for conventional beauty is tied to anti-woke sentiments. Other options either misinterpret the relationship between beauty and wokeness or present perspectives not supported by the document. Therefore, the correct option is B.",

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media.

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left).

    "reasoning": "The image and text focus on Sydney Sweeney’s appearance and the debate surrounding it, particularly highlighting how her beauty is seen by some as a challenge to \"woke\" culture. This aligns with the sentiment in Document 1, which discusses how admiration for Sweeney's beauty is framed as a stance against wokeness. The other options do not connect to the cultural critique presented in the meme or the documents. Document 0 is irrelevant to this meme context, as it discusses a completely different topic about eye color and racial identity. Thus, the correct interpretation centers on the relationship between beauty and cultural resistance, making option A the most fitting.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What does the visual composition of the meme featuring Sydney Sweeney most likely symbolize in the context of social discourse?\n\nA) The celebration of traditional beauty standards against progressive ideals  \nB) The promotion of diversity and inclusion among women in media  \nC) The critique of celebrity culture and its impact on public perception  \nD) The rejection of social media as a platform for political discussion",
    "reasoning": "The image caption refers to Sydney Sweeney posing with a magazine, which aligns with the themes discussed in Document 1. This document highlights a sentiment that Sweeney's appearance, particularly her emphasis on conventional beauty, is positioned as a critique of \"wokeness\" and a celebration of traditional beauty standards. The discussions around her appearance reflect broader cultural debates about beauty and societal values, making option A the most relevant choice. Document 0 discusses language and dialects, which is not relevant to the meme context, while Document 1 provides a clear interpretation of the meme's symbolism regarding beauty and social discourse. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The meme focuses on the irony of how an actress’s physical appearance, specifically her breasts, is being used to argue against 'wokeness,' as highlighted in the editorial from the National Post mentioned in Document 1. The phrase \"harbingers of the death of woke\" suggests that society should admire beauty despite the prevailing wokeness narrative, which emphasizes diversity and inclusion. This aligns with option A, indicating that the admiration for conventional beauty contradicts the values often associated with wokeness. The other options do not directly address the core irony presented in the meme.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What contradictory situation is being highlighted in the meme titled \"Sydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs\"?\n\nA) The admiration of beauty contradicts the principles of diversity and inclusion.  \nB) Sydney Sweeney's outfits are considered too conservative for modern audiences.  \nC) The media is promoting woke ideals through its coverage of Sweeney.  \nD) Social media users unanimously agree on the definition of wokeness.",
    "reasoning": "The relevant document for understanding the context of the meme is Document 1, which discusses Sydney Sweeney's appearance and its implications regarding traditional beauty standards versus woke culture. It highlights how some conservative views interpret her attractiveness as a rejection of wokeness, thus creating a contradiction between appreciating beauty and the criticisms of such admiration in the context of diversity and inclusion. The options B, C, and D are not supported by the documents, as they do not accurately reflect the content or the sentiments expressed in the meme or the accompanying text. Therefore, option A correctly identifies the irony in the situation.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The meme and accompanying documents highlight a clash between conservative viewpoints that celebrate traditional beauty standards and critiques of \"woke\" culture. Document 0 discusses how Sydney Sweeney's appearance has been interpreted by some as a rejection of woke values, with a focus on physical beauty being seen as a challenge to contemporary societal norms. This aligns with option B, which captures the essence of the ideological conflict surrounding traditional versus modern values. Option A, while relevant, is too narrow as it focuses solely on beauty standards without addressing the wider ideological context. Options C and D are unrelated to the specific themes presented in the documents. \n\nThus, the most appropriate answer is B, as it encompasses the broader societal conflict represented in the meme about Sweeney's cleavage being a symbol against woke culture.",

    "reasoning": "The meme features a tweet by David Doel referencing an article from the National Post that discusses Sydney Sweeney's beauty and its implications for the concept of \"wokeness.\" The article provocatively questions whether Sweeney's breasts symbolize the decline of woke culture, aligning with the sentiment expressed in Document 0 about the backlash against \"wokeness\" when it comes to beauty standards. Option A aligns with the idea that beauty should be admired despite societal critiques, which is supported by both the image and the text. Options B and C misinterpret the relationship between beauty and wokeness, while option D dismisses the relevance of the media critique, which is central to the discussion in the meme. Thus, A is the most accurate representation of the meme's message.",

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The correct answer is B. The image and accompanying text refer to a National Post article that questions whether Sydney Sweeney’s physical appearance, particularly her breasts, symbolizes a decline in \"wokeness.\" This aligns with the sentiment expressed in the meme that Sweeney’s attractiveness is seen as a challenge to progressive values, as detailed in Document 1, which discusses the backlash against \"wokeness\" and connects it to her beauty. Option A misinterprets the meme's intent, while C and D are not relevant to the specific critique of wokeness presented in the meme.",

    "reasoning": "The meme references a specific cultural moment involving Sydney Sweeney that sparked discussions about beauty, wokeness, and media representation, particularly among conservative commentators. Document 1 discusses how Sydney Sweeney's appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" and the subsequent reactions highlighted a conflict between traditional beauty standards and modern \"woke\" culture. This aligns closely with option B, which captures the essence of the anti-woke sentiment that emerged in response to her portrayal and the discussions it generated. While options A, C, and D relate to aspects of the broader context, they do not directly encapsulate the main phenomenon being critiqued or discussed in the meme. \n\nThus, option B is the most accurate choice.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

The meme critiques the focus on her physical appearance, suggesting that viewers are more interested in her looks than the show's content. This aligns with option **B**, which addresses the objectification of women's bodies in media. Although option **A** mentions woke culture, it doesn't directly address the critique of objectification present in the meme. Therefore, option **B** is the most accurate answer.

    "reasoning": "To analyze the social message of the meme, we can reference Document 0, which discusses Sydney Sweeney's cleavage-focused appearance on Saturday Night Live and the ensuing debate around beauty and \"wokeness.\" The perception that Sweeney's beauty garners a conservative backlash against woke culture is a central theme. Option B directly aligns with this context, as it articulates the tension between conservative views on beauty and the criticisms from woke culture. The other options either introduce unrelated themes (like modesty) or misinterpret the significance of the red scarf in this specific context. Document 1 does not provide any relevant insights regarding the social message of this meme. Thus, B is the most fitting interpretation.",

This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left).

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The meme discusses Sydney Sweeney's appearance which was interpreted by some as a challenge to \"woke\" culture. Document 0 elaborates on how Sweeney's beauty was defended by some as a rejection of woke ideals, suggesting that the admiration for her beauty is ironic given the context of anti-woke sentiments. This aligns with option A, situational irony, because it highlights the contradiction between the praise for conventional beauty and the values of the anti-woke movement. The other options do not align with the context presented in the documents. Option B is incorrect as it does not refer to verbal statements being contrary to feelings but rather to a broader cultural discussion. Options C and D also misinterpret the situation by applying different types of irony that do not fit the meme's context. Thus, the correct identification of irony in the meme is situational.",

    "reasoning": "The meme juxtaposes a serious conversation with a crude commentary on Sydney Sweeney's physical attributes, indicating a disconnect between the expected appreciation of talent (in this case, for the show \"Euphoria\") and the actual focus on her body. This aligns with situational irony, where the audience recognizes that the main value may not lie in the talent, but rather in superficial attributes. The context from Document 1 supports this by discussing how admiration for Sweeney’s beauty is framed as a rejection of \"woke\" values, which critique such superficial judgments. Other options like dramatic or verbal irony do not fit as well given the explicit nature of the commentary. \n\nThus, the correct answer is A.",

This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter.

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media.

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter.

    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme and identify the opposing social groups, we can refer to Document 1, which discusses the backlash and debate following Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live. The document highlights how some conservatives view her attractiveness as a rejection of \"woke\" culture, leading to discussions that pit traditional beauty standards against modern views on diversity and inclusion. The sentiment expressed by figures in Document 1 indicates a clear opposition between conservatives (who admire Sweeney's beauty) and those who advocate for diversity and inclusion (often labeled as \"woke\"). Thus, option D, \"Beauty advocates and diversity advocates,\" accurately captures this social conflict, as it reflects the ongoing cultural debates over beauty standards and inclusivity. Options A, B, and C either do not reflect the specific opposition described or misidentify the main social groups involved.",

    "reasoning": "The meme's context in Document 0 discusses Sydney Sweeney's cleavage as a symbol against so-called \"woke culture,\" emphasizing that admiration for beauty contradicts the ideals of diversity and inclusion. The image caption about a woman with a red scarf does not provide this specific cultural critique and lacks the context of Sweeney's actions and their societal implications. Therefore, when viewed separately, the image caption does not convey the same sentiment, making option C the correct choice as it highlights that the image alone does not capture the nuanced debate around wokeness presented in the document. Option A, while potentially true, does not specifically address the change in sentiment regarding wokeness, and options B and D do not accurately represent the implications of the original meme's context.",

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics.

    "reasoning": "To analyze the viewpoint presented in the meme, we can reference Document 1, which discusses how Sydney Sweeney's appearance and beauty are perceived as an affront to woke culture. The document highlights that admiration for Sweeney's beauty is framed as a counterpoint to \"wokeness,\" suggesting that conventional beauty is being validated in a cultural context that often discourages such admiration. The meme itself echoes this sentiment by humorously emphasizing the focus on Sweeney's physical attributes in discussions about the show \"Euphoria.\"  \n\nIn contrast, Document 0 focuses on a fictional scale that categorizes people based on race, which is not directly relevant to the meme's commentary on beauty and woke culture. Therefore, the most accurate option is B, as it aligns with the idea that conventional beauty is perceived as a challenge to \"woke\" narratives.",

    "reasoning": "The meme focuses on Sydney Sweeney's appearance and its implications regarding the criticism of woke culture. The relevant oracle document (0) discusses how her beauty and the admiration for it are positioned as a rebuttal against wokeness, as articulated in Amy Hamm's article in the National Post. The document also outlines how this admiration has sparked debates about beauty and societal norms, suggesting that appreciating Sweeney's looks is a way to push back against the perceived constraints of woke ideology. In contrast, document (1) discusses a completely different topic related to intelligence and racial theories, making it irrelevant to the meme's context. Therefore, option B accurately reflects the argument presented in the meme.",

    "reasoning": "The meme depicts a person expressing overwhelming happiness despite experiencing pain, which aligns with the sentiment that the joy of competition can outweigh physical discomfort. This directly correlates with option A, which emphasizes the positive feelings associated with preparing for a competition, even when it involves hardship. The other options either misinterpret the context of the meme or focus on aspects not represented in the image, such as danger or health concerns. The oracle document about Sydney Sweeney does not relate to the meme's theme, making it a distractor. Therefore, the relevant conclusion is that the meme conveys a positive cultural message about competition.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What cultural message is conveyed by the meme titled \"sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs_4\"?\n\nA) The value of beauty is being celebrated in opposition to current social norms.  \nB) The meme critiques the portrayal of women in media as overly sexualized.  \nC) It promotes the idea that wokeness is harmful to society.  \nD) The meme suggests that conversations about race should be avoided.",
    "reasoning": "The correct answer is A. The meme connects to the discussion surrounding Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the commentary on beauty and \"wokeness\" as outlined in Document 1. This document indicates that Sweeney's popularity and conventional attractiveness are viewed by some as a pushback against the ideals of diversity and inclusion promoted by \"woke\" culture. The humorous portrayal of a woman with a funny face could be interpreted as a lighthearted take on the serious discussions about beauty and societal standards, further supporting the notion that beauty is being celebrated in the context of rejecting the constraints of wokeness. Options B, C, and D are less directly supported by the provided documents and do not capture the primary cultural message effectively.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left).

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media.

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter.

This aligns with option A, which captures the essence of finding joy in the pain of competition.",
    "reasoning": "The visual representation of a person in distress yet expressing happiness reflects the paradoxical feelings athletes often experience, especially in demanding sports like powerlifting. Document 1 does not provide relevant information about the meme's specific context, while Document 0 offers insight into the nature of memes but does not address powerlifting. Thus, the correct interpretation is focused on the irony expressed in the meme itself.",

    "reasoning": "The meme depicts a person expressing extreme emotion, juxtaposing pain with happiness, which is a common theme in sports culture, particularly among powerlifters. This highlights the paradox where athletes endure significant discomfort yet feel joy about competing, making it ironic. Document 0 discusses the societal perceptions of beauty and cultural commentary, which relates to how memes can critique or satirize cultural phenomena. However, Document 1 does not provide relevant context for understanding this specific meme about powerlifting. Therefore, option B best captures the satirical element of the meme, while options A, C, and D do not accurately reflect its intent.",

The mention of mocking sentiments about beauty in the context of \"wokeness is dead\" signifies a satirical take, as it exaggerates the reaction to her appearance and the implications of admiring beauty. This aligns with Option B, which states that the meme uses humor to highlight the absurdity of linking beauty to cultural critiques of wokeness.

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** In what way does this meme incorporate satirical elements?\n\nA) It mocks the physical pain experienced by powerlifters before a competition, contrasting it with their excitement.\n\nB) It highlights the seriousness of powerlifting by showing an athlete in distress.\n\nC) It suggests that the joy of competing outweighs physical suffering, promoting a positive message about sports.\n\nD) It uses an exaggerated expression to depict the struggles of powerlifting, implying that the sport is not taken seriously.",
    "reasoning": "The relevant document is the one discussing Sydney Sweeney's \"Anti-Woke Boobs,\" as it highlights the use of satire and irony in social media discussions, particularly through exaggeration and humor. In the meme, the face of the woman expressing extreme happiness despite the context of pain plays into a satirical take on how athletes often feel about competitions, which can be physically taxing yet fulfilling. This aligns with option A, as it captures the essence of the exaggeration and irony present in the meme. Options B and C do not reflect the satirical nature, and option D misinterprets the intent of the expression. \n\nThus, the best choice is A.",

    "question_with_options": "### Question:\nHow does the meme about powerlifters relate to social dynamics or status among athletes?\n\nA) It illustrates the physical pain associated with intense training, showing the sacrifices athletes make for recognition.  \nB) It highlights the joy of competing despite physical discomfort, emphasizing a sense of camaraderie among athletes.  \nC) It suggests that powerlifting is a more prestigious sport than others, thus elevating the status of its practitioners.  \nD) It implies that only those who endure pain can achieve success, reinforcing a toxic view of competition.",
    "reasoning": "This meme reflects the emotional and physical challenges faced by athletes, particularly powerlifters, as they prepare for competitions. Document 1 provides insight into how public perception of beauty and success can create social dynamics, but it doesn't directly address the specific context of powerlifting. Document 0 discusses the validity of certain cultural claims, which is not relevant to this meme's focus on the personal experiences of athletes. The correct option is B, as it captures the essence of the meme: the happiness derived from competing despite hardships, which fosters a sense of community among athletes.",

This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

It identifies how Sweeney's beauty has been co-opted by some as a statement against 'wokeness,' illustrating a power dynamic where beauty is seen as a weapon against social norms.

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** How does the meme \"Powerlifters two weeks out from a meet\" interact with the themes of emotional resilience and competition, as depicted in the provided documents?\n\nA) It reflects the joy of powerlifting without any mention of pain.  \nB) It highlights the contrast between physical pain and emotional happiness in competition.  \nC) It suggests that competition leads to only negative emotions.  \nD) It focuses solely on the aesthetic appeal of powerlifting.",
    "reasoning": "The meme juxtaposes the physical pain powerlifters experience leading up to a competition with their emotional happiness, capturing the essence of resilience in the face of hardship. This aligns with the themes of competition and emotional complexity, as indicated in Document 1, where societal sentiments about beauty and strength are discussed. Document 0, while discussing a different meme format, indirectly supports the idea that cultural perceptions can influence emotional responses in competitive contexts. Thus, option B is the most accurate in reflecting how the meme presents this duality. Options A, C, and D do not capture the central contrast illustrated in the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

The backlash against \"woke culture\" and the emphasis on beauty as a defiance against it are central themes in this document. Document 1 discusses fabricated statistics regarding immigrant assimilation, which is not relevant to the meme's context.

We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left).

The documents primarily discuss the controversy surrounding Sydney Sweeney's appearance and how her beauty is framed as a rejection of \"woke\" culture, particularly in the editorial that argues admiration for Sweeney's attractiveness counters the prevailing notions associated with wokeness. Document 0 provides clear context about the meme's origins and the reactions to Sweeney's portrayal. Document 1 discusses an unrelated topic about racial stereotypes and does not pertain to the cultural sentiment surrounding Sweeney's appearance. Therefore, A is the most relevant answer.",

The meme portrays Sweeney's beauty as a challenge to the constraints of \"woke\" culture, as highlighted by various Twitter reactions and articles that engage with the theme of beauty being a point of contention in current social discourse. Document 1 is not relevant here as it discusses a fictional concept unrelated to the meme's context. \n\nThus, option B is the most fitting answer, as it captures the essence of how the meme critiques societal expectations surrounding beauty and the implications of \"woke\" ideologies.",

    "reasoning": "The correct answer is B because the context of the meme revolves around Sydney Sweeney's appearance on SNL and the subsequent discussions regarding beauty and 'woke' culture, as highlighted in Document 1. The document mentions that admiring Sweeney's beauty has become a form of resistance against 'wokeness,' thus symbolizing a conflict between traditional views of beauty and the ideals of inclusivity promoted by 'woke' culture. Options A, C, and D do not accurately capture the primary sentiment expressed in the meme or the associated discussions. Document 0, which discusses dialect memes and racial groups, is not relevant to understanding this particular meme's symbolism. Therefore, the most fitting answer is B.",

    "reasoning": "The image prominently features Sydney Sweeney, who has become a symbol in discussions regarding beauty and \"wokeness,\" particularly following her appearance on Saturday Night Live. Document 1 discusses how her attractiveness has been positioned as a counter to woke culture, with sentiments expressed that admiring her beauty is a rebellion against contemporary social norms. This aligns with option B, which emphasizes the endorsement of anti-woke sentiment through her conventional attractiveness. The other options either misinterpret the context or fail to capture the essence of the meme's commentary on societal debates. Thus, the relevant document is Document 1 as it provides insight into the cultural implications surrounding Sydney Sweeney's image and its reception online.",

    "reasoning": "To understand the satirical elements of the meme, we can refer to Document ID 1, which discusses the public reaction to Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live and how it was framed in the context of \"wokeness.\" The document notes that some conservative individuals interpreted her beauty and outfits as symbolic of a backlash against woke culture. The satire lies in the absurdity of suggesting that appreciating someone's beauty can signify a rejection of social justice ideals, as highlighted by the mockery of the National Post article. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as it captures the irony of equating physical attributes with cultural critiques. The other options either do not accurately reflect the content of the meme or suggest a serious tone that contradicts the satirical nature of the meme.",

The humor lies in the exaggerated portrayal of Sweeney’s appearance as a symbol of resistance against wokeness, which aligns with option A. It underscores the satire by illustrating how a trivial aspect of pop culture (her appearance) can be used to make broader social commentary.

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The image features Sydney Sweeney, who is referenced in Document 1. This document discusses her appearance on Saturday Night Live and the subsequent social media discourse that framed her attractiveness as a challenge to \"woke\" culture. The meme's focus on her physical appearance, particularly the emphasis on her cleavage, aligns with the sentiments expressed in the document. Thus, the most fitting answer is B, as it highlights the critique of \"wokeness\" through the lens of her attractiveness. Options A, C, and D do not accurately reflect the content of the documents.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** How does the image of a woman holding a sign with a picture of a man relate to the discussions around Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the concept of \"wokeness\"?\n\nA) It emphasizes the idea that women's beauty is being celebrated in opposition to what some consider the restrictive nature of wokeness.  \nB) It suggests that men are the primary critics of beauty standards imposed by woke culture.  \nC) It proposes that the sign is mocking the entire discussion around wokeness and beauty.  \nD) It indicates that the woman is a supporter of woke ideology against the beauty standard represented by the man.",
    "reasoning": "The meme's image is complemented by the ongoing discussions around Sydney Sweeney's appearance, which has been linked to broader debates on beauty and wokeness, as highlighted in Document 1. The article argues that appreciating Sweeney's beauty counters the woke narrative that discourages admiration of conventional attractiveness. Therefore, option A best captures the essence of the meme by linking beauty celebration to an anti-woke sentiment. Options B, C, and D do not accurately reflect the tone and content of the discussions surrounding Sweeney and wokeness as presented in the documents.",

The meme suggests that admiration for Sweeney's physical appearance is a stance against \"woke\" culture, aligning with option A, which reflects the underlying bias that beauty is valued more when it opposes social justice themes. Options B and C also relate to the meme's message, but A more accurately captures the critical perspective on the relationship between beauty and cultural critique. Therefore, the best answer is A.",

This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left).

The humor and irony in the meme suggest that feminine allure can be viewed as a counter to social justice narratives, making option A the most relevant and fitting metaphorical interpretation. Document 1 discusses a different topic entirely regarding intelligence distribution, making it irrelevant to this meme analysis. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

The relevant oracle document (Document 0) details how Sydney Sweeney's appearance and beauty are used by some conservatives as a symbol against \"wokeness,\" indicating a contradictory situation where admiration for her beauty is positioned as a rejection of woke culture. This directly aligns with the theme of the meme, which seems to highlight the irony in conservatives using her attractiveness to declare \"wokeness\" dead. \n\nOption B is misleading as it simplifies the meme's message and does not capture the irony present in the situation. Option C is irrelevant as it does not address the specific contradiction being highlighted in the context of Sweeney and wokeness. Option D misrepresents the context, as Sweeney is not depicted as a victim but rather as a figure of admiration that some conservatives rally around to make a statement against wokeness.\n\nThus, the best answer is A.",

    "reasoning": "The relevant document is Document 0, which discusses the narrative surrounding Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live and how her beauty is being used as a critique of woke culture. The meme plays on the irony of using physical attraction as a weapon against what is perceived as restrictive social norms. The document outlines how Sweeney's appearance is viewed favorably by some as a rejection of \"wokeness,\" thereby creating the contradiction that beauty, which is often criticized in woke discussions, is being celebrated. Option B aligns with this interpretation, highlighting the contradiction of using beauty to challenge societal norms.

    "reasoning": "The meme aligns closely with Document 1, which discusses the societal implications of Sydney Sweeney's portrayal and how her physical appearance has become a focal point in debates about wokeness. The article highlights how admiration for Sweeney's beauty can be seen as a rejection of the 'woke' culture that criticizes conventional standards of attractiveness. This underscores the power dynamics at play—those who appreciate traditional beauty may feel empowered to reject contemporary cultural critiques. In contrast, Document 0 about the \"Racial Harmony Quotient\" does not provide relevant insights into beauty standards or social discourse related to wokeness. Therefore, the most accurate answer is A, as it reflects how beauty can challenge or reinforce cultural values and power structures.",

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter.

    "reasoning": "The meme directly addresses the cultural commentary surrounding Sydney Sweeney's appearance and its implications on the concept of \"wokeness.\" Document 1 elaborates on how Sweeney's portrayal and the focus on her physical attributes sparked discussions about beauty standards and societal judgments, indicating that admiration for her beauty is positioned as a challenge to \"woke\" ideologies. This reflects a power dynamic where beauty is leveraged to critique or undermine social movements. The other options relate less to the specific context of the meme or misinterpret its implications. For example, B and D do not connect to the content of the meme or the documents provided.  \n\nThus, the most relevant answer is A, as it captures the essence of how beauty is being positioned against social movements.",

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The correct option is C, as the meme reflects the sentiment shared in Document 1, which discusses how Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the admiration for her beauty are being framed as a rejection of wokeness. The document highlights various social media reactions that connect her physical appearance to the idea of wokeness being \"dead,\" indicating that this meme uses Sweeney's image as a cultural commentary on the rejection of woke ideals.

    "reasoning": "The meme and its caption suggest that Sydney Sweeney's appearance is being used to critique or challenge \"woke\" culture, which aligns with the sentiments expressed in Document 0. The document discusses how Sweeney's beauty is presented as a counter to the prevailing narratives around beauty and wokeness. Therefore, option A is the most relevant viewpoint reflected in the meme.

    "reasoning": "The meme features Sydney Sweeney in a context that critiques \"woke\" culture, referencing her physical appearance as a symbol of resistance against it. This aligns closely with the discussions in Document 1, where Sweeney's beauty is contrasted against the critique of wokeness, suggesting that admiration for traditional beauty is a political statement. Document 0 is not relevant as it discusses the \"Blue-Eye Phenomenon,\" which has no connection to the themes presented in the meme. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the meme's symbolism relates to the conflict between conservative values and contemporary culture.",

    "reasoning": "The relevant document for understanding the meme context is Document 1, which discusses Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live and how it sparked debates about 'wokeness'. The meme's imagery of a man with a black face can be interpreted as a metaphor for the critique of how identity and beauty are represented and perceived in a 'woke' culture, possibly reflecting on the backlash against traditional beauty standards. This aligns with option B, which suggests that the meme symbolizes an endorsement of traditional beauty standards against progressive ideals, as seen in the discussions around Sweeney's appearance. Options A, C, and D do not directly connect to the primary theme presented in the meme related to Sweeney's situation and the concept of 'wokeness'. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",

The text in the meme portrays Sweeney in a controversial light, suggesting a dichotomy between good and evil, which reflects the cultural tensions highlighted in the documents.

Option D is unrelated, as it pertains to a different context regarding racial themes found in Document 1.

    "reasoning": "The meme depicts a man with a black face, which directly relates to issues of race and representation, thus highlighting racial inequalities. The documents provide context to this by discussing the backlash against Sydney Sweeney's portrayal in a \"woke\" culture, particularly Document 1, which emphasizes the cultural debates surrounding beauty and social norms. The meme suggests that discussions about race and beauty are intertwined, and the structural inequality may stem from how racial identities are perceived in the context of societal beauty standards. Therefore, option A (the perception that physical appearance can undermine cultural discussions) most accurately captures the structural inequality presented in the meme, as it relates to how individuals are judged based on appearance versus the deeper issues of race and identity. Other options either misinterpret the context or focus on different aspects of the discussion, such as Document 0, which addresses a different facet of racial bias in technology rather than the societal implications of beauty and race. Thus, A is the most relevant answer.",

    "reasoning": "The meme references Sydney Sweeney's portrayal and the surrounding discourse on beauty and wokeness, which highlights issues related to gender representation and societal expectations of women. Document 0 discusses the backlash against Sweeney's appearance and its implications on the perception of beauty in a \"woke\" culture, making it relevant to the question of gender inequality in media representation. Document 1, on the other hand, deals with racial IQ theories, which are not related to the structural inequalities presented in the meme. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** How do the image and text in the meme titled \"sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs_7\" complement each other's meaning regarding cultural perceptions?\n\nA) The image depicts Sydney Sweeney as a symbol of conservatism, while the text criticizes her appearance.  \nB) The image portrays a horror theme, and the text suggests that Sydney Sweeney's actions are viewed as evil by some, linking to the anti-woke sentiment.  \nC) The image and text focus solely on Sydney Sweeney's beauty without any cultural implications.  \nD) The image depicts a comedic take on the anti-woke movement, while the text is serious and condemning.",
    "reasoning": "The meme combines a horror-themed image with text that describes Sydney Sweeney's actions as \"diabolical\" and \"sacrilegious.\" This aligns with the sentiments expressed in Document 0, where Sweeney's appearance is linked to cultural debates about beauty and wokeness. The text suggests that her portrayal is perceived negatively by some, tying back to the discussion in the document about the backlash against \"woke\" culture. The other options do not accurately capture the interaction between the image and text regarding cultural perceptions.",

    "reasoning": "The documents relevant to the question are primarily Document 0, which discusses Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the reactions surrounding it, particularly in the context of beauty being an affront to woke culture. The image caption regarding a man with a black face does not directly correlate to the discussions in Document 0 but may imply a critique of how racial stereotypes intersect with beauty discussions. However, it does not provide any explicit support for the admiration of Sweeney's beauty nor does it mock beauty standards directly. Instead, it could highlight the trivialization of serious racial issues in light of beauty discussions, making option A the most fitting. Document 1 discusses the 'Racial Barometer' meme series but does not contribute to understanding the specific meme about Sweeney. Therefore, the most cohesive interpretation of the meme in relation to the documents suggests that it points to the trivialization of racial issues amidst beauty standards. \n\nThus, the correct answer is A) It illustrates that racial issues are being trivialized in the context of discussing beauty standards.",

Option D is the most accurate because it captures the essence of the meme's message, reflecting the sentiments detailed in the document. \n\nOptions A and C misinterpret the tone of the meme, as it leans more toward satire rather than serious condemnation.

    "reasoning": "The meme's perspective centers around the idea that Sydney Sweeney's appearance is a symbol against \"wokeness,\" as discussed in Document 1. A potential counterargument is that focusing on her physical appearance (Option A) diminishes the broader contributions and achievements of women in the entertainment industry, which is a relevant critique of the narrative that beauty equates to a stance against wokeness. Option B suggests that wokeness does not factor into assessments of beauty and talent, while Option C points out that the meme doesn't capture the diversity of opinions on wokeness, which is also valid. Option D addresses the oversimplification of cultural discussions by framing Sweeney solely in an anti-woke context. However, A is the strongest counterargument as it directly critiques the reduction of women's identities to their physical attributes in a broader societal context. \n\nThus, the best answer that encapsulates the counterarguments is A.",

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The meme suggests a divisive perspective on Sydney Sweeney's impact on \"wokeness\" and implies that her attractiveness is a challenge to contemporary values. Document 1 discusses the reactions to Sweeney's appearance and the ensuing debate, indicating that her image may be viewed positively by some while others mock the sentiment. Each option presents a valid counterargument that highlights different aspects of the discourse surrounding the meme. Therefore, the correct answer is D) All of the above, as it encapsulates the complexity of opinions surrounding her portrayal and the concept of \"wokeness.\"",

The sentiment that her beauty represents a challenge to wokeness aligns with option A, making it the most relevant choice.

    "reasoning": "The meme is centered around Sydney Sweeney’s appearance on Saturday Night Live, where her outfit and the subsequent commentary on her beauty sparked discussions about \"wokeness\" and traditional beauty standards. The relevant document (Document 0) discusses how Sweeney's appearance was perceived as an affront to \"woke culture,\" suggesting that admiration for her beauty represents a rejection of woke values. Document 1 is unrelated, as it discusses fabricated statistics regarding immigrant assimilation, which does not connect to the meme's context. Therefore, the correct answer is A) The resurgence of traditional beauty standards in media.",

    "reasoning": "The image caption describes a woman in a bikini holding a sign, which aligns with the discussions in Document 1 about Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the backlash against 'woke' culture. The sentiment expressed in the document suggests that admiration for Sweeney's beauty is viewed as a form of resistance against 'wokeness', making option A the most fitting interpretation. Document 0, while relevant for contextual understanding of racial stereotypes, does not relate directly to the symbols in this meme. Thus, the primary focus should be on the implications of beauty and its relationship with cultural debates as highlighted in Document 1. This leads to the conclusion that option A, which speaks to rejecting beauty standards imposed by woke culture, is the best choice.",

The humor in the meme plays on the irony that societal beauty standards are being positioned as a rejection of \"wokeness,\" which aligns with option B.

    "reasoning": "To understand the humor in the meme, we can refer to Document 1, which discusses how Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live was interpreted by some conservatives as a rejection of 'woke' culture. The humor comes from the irony of using conventional beauty to challenge modern social norms, which is illustrated in a satirical manner in the meme itself. This aligns with option B, which highlights the tension between beauty standards and 'woke' culture. The other options either miss the central theme of beauty versus social critique or focus on less relevant aspects, such as popularity or clothing as a political expression. Therefore, the best answer that encapsulates the satire is B.",

    "reasoning": "Document 0 discusses how Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the subsequent reactions to it sparked debates about \"wokeness\" and beauty standards, suggesting that her physical attractiveness serves as a counter to progressive social movements. The editorial in the National Post argues that admiring Sweeney's beauty is a form of resistance against 'woke' culture, indicating that attractiveness can influence social status and power dynamics. Document 1 is irrelevant here, as it deals with fictional statistics about racial integration and does not pertain to the topic at hand. Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of how the meme interacts with themes of social status and power dynamics.",

    "reasoning": "The meme in question revolves around Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live and the subsequent commentary on her beauty as a challenge to \"wokeness.\" Document 0 provides insight into how Sweeney's beauty is framed as a form of social resistance, particularly in the context of conservative backlash against woke culture. It discusses how admiration for her physical appearance is positioned as a counter-narrative to contemporary social justice ideals, thus linking beauty with power dynamics. Options A, B, and C all touch on themes of gender and beauty, but C most directly correlates with the idea that beauty is depicted as a form of resistance against societal norms, as presented in Document 0. Option D is irrelevant as Document 1 does not pertain to the meme's context about gender and beauty. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",

    "reasoning": "The meme's text, \"SHE'S GOT TWO GOOD POINTS,\" coupled with the image of Sydney Sweeney in a revealing outfit, plays into the discussions highlighted in Document 1 about how her appearance has sparked debates regarding \"wokeness.\" The text humorously implies Sweeney's physical attributes are noteworthy in a context that critiques or challenges societal norms, fitting with the sentiment in Document 1 that celebrates her beauty as an affront to \"woke\" culture. Thus, the most relevant option is C, as it directly connects the meme's humor to the broader discussion about beauty and \"wokeness.\" Document 0 does not apply here, as it focuses on racial identity rather than beauty standards.",

The article mentions how admiring Sweeney's beauty is viewed as a stance against wokeness. The image caption indicates that the woman is holding a sign, likely making a statement that fits this context.

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What underlying biases can be inferred from the \"Sydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs\" meme, particularly regarding societal perceptions of beauty and 'wokeness'?\n\nA) It promotes the idea that beauty can only exist outside of 'woke' culture.  \nB) It suggests that women should dress modestly to avoid criticism from conservatives.  \nC) It implies that only men can critique 'woke' culture effectively.  \nD) It reinforces the stereotype that beauty is inherently linked to moral values.",
    "reasoning": "The correct option is A. This inference is supported by Document 1, which discusses how the admiration for Sydney Sweeney’s beauty is framed as an opposition to 'woke' culture, indicating a bias that idealizes beauty while dismissing the values associated with diversity and inclusion. The discussions in the document highlight how the commentary around Sweeney's appearance is tied to broader societal debates about 'wokeness' and beauty standards, suggesting that beauty is seen as a counter to perceived cultural overreach. Options B, C, and D do not directly relate to the central theme presented in the documents. Thus, the most relevant bias inferred from the meme aligns with option A.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left).

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media.

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left).

    "reasoning": "The meme reflects a cultural perception that celebrates traditional beauty in opposition to \"woke\" ideals, as evidenced by the content in Document 0 where Sydney Sweeney's appearance is framed as a challenge to wokeness. The discussions in the document highlight a sentiment among certain social groups that appreciating beauty, specifically Sweeney's, is a rejection of \"woke\" ideologies. Document 1, which discusses the distortion of history based on racial connections, is irrelevant to this cultural context. Therefore, the most accurate answer is B.",

    "reasoning": "The meme discusses Sydney Sweeney's cleavage in the context of \"ending wokeness,\" which is a metaphor for challenging or rejecting the principles of social justice and inclusivity often associated with \"woke\" culture. This directly correlates with the sentiments expressed in Document 0, where Sweeney's appearance and societal reactions are debated in relation to beauty standards and wokeness. Document 1 is not relevant to this question as it discusses a completely different topic about eye color and racial identity.

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The meme centers around Sydney Sweeney's appearance in a provocative dress, which has been interpreted in the context of a cultural debate about \"wokeness.\" Document 1 discusses how Sydney Sweeney's beauty and her attire are portrayed as a challenge to \"woke\" culture. Specifically, it mentions how admiration for her beauty is framed as a rejection of the constraints imposed by modern diversity and inclusion discourses. This aligns with option C, which suggests that traditional beauty can counteract modern cultural critiques. The other options either misinterpret the sentiment expressed or do not align with the main theme of the meme. Therefore, the correct interpretation is C.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What is the primary social commentary being made in the meme about Sydney Sweeney's appearance and its relation to \"wokeness\"?\n\nA) It suggests that expressing admiration for beauty is a rejection of social justice movements.  \nB) It humorously claims that Sweeney's cleavage has no impact on societal issues.  \nC) It implies that beauty standards are a form of oppression.  \nD) It critiques the notion that \"wokeness\" can be defeated by a celebrity's appearance.",
    "reasoning": "The relevant document for understanding the meme is Document 0, which discusses the sentiment that Sydney Sweeney's appearance has been interpreted by some as a rejection of \"woke\" culture. The commentary surrounding her outfit and the reactions it received highlight the idea that admiration for her beauty is viewed as a stance against social justice ideals. The meme’s phrasing and visual elements directly reflect this sentiment, questioning whether her cleavage can \"end wokeness.\" Document 1, focused on race and facial recognition, is not relevant here. Thus, the best answer is A, as it aligns with the article's argument that appreciating beauty contradicts the principles that some associate with wokeness.",

The document explains that the admiration of Sweeney's beauty is positioned as a rejection of woke ideals, indicating that choices concerning beauty standards can be politicized. This supports option B, which suggests that the meme aligns with conservative critiques against woke culture. However, the humor also appears to satirize the absurdity of equating physical beauty with the death of wokeness, which aligns with option D. Given the context of the meme, option D is more aligned with the satirical nature of the commentary, implying that it mocks the seriousness with which some people treat the relationship between beauty and cultural discourse. Document 1 does not provide relevant context for this specific meme. Therefore, the best choice reflecting the social commentary is option D.",

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "To answer this question, we should focus on the context provided in Document 1, which discusses the sentiment among some conservatives regarding Sydney Sweeney's appearance and how it relates to \"woke\" culture. The document indicates that there is a conflict between conservative views, which celebrate Sweeney's traditional attractiveness as a rejection of wokeness, and the broader criticism from liberal or progressive circles that might view this admiration as problematic within the framework of diversity and inclusion (often associated with \"woke\" culture). \n\nDocument 0, while providing context about \"Racial Harmony Quotient\" memes, does not relate directly to the social conflict depicted in the meme about Sydney Sweeney. Therefore, the relevant answer is A) Conservatives and liberals, as they represent the opposing social groups in this context. \n\nThe other options do not fit the specific social conflict presented in the meme.

    "reasoning": "The meme suggests that Sydney Sweeney's appearance on SNL signifies a rejection of \"wokeness,\" a viewpoint that can be challenged on several grounds. Document 0 discusses how the admiration for Sweeney's beauty is framed as a counter to wokeness but may overlook deeper social issues, making option A relevant. Additionally, the meme's focus on physical appearance diverts attention from critical discussions about representation and equity, supporting option B. Lastly, there is a growing movement that values rejecting conventional beauty standards, which is contradicted by the meme's premise, backing option C. Therefore, all these points represent valid counterarguments. Thus, the correct answer is D, as it encompasses all the relevant counterarguments.",

    "reasoning": "To address the question, we can reference Document 1, which discusses how some conservatives view Sydney Sweeney's beauty as a challenge to \"woke culture.\" The document mentions the debate surrounding her appearance and how it has led to mixed reactions online, including admiration and mockery. Option A presents a counterargument that aligns with the perspective that \"woke culture\" should celebrate various forms of beauty, not just conventional attractiveness. Option B also serves as a strong counterargument by emphasizing that focusing on Sweeney’s appearance could sideline more significant social issues like gender equality. Option C, while relevant, does not provide a counterargument but rather reinforces the initial sentiment. Option D completely dismisses the idea of any counterarguments, which does not align with the critical thinking aspect of the question. Therefore, the best answers that provide counterarguments are A and B. However, B is more directly aligned with the critical thinking aspect of why focusing on beauty can be problematic in discussions of \"woke culture.\" Thus, B is the strongest counterargument.",

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The meme references Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the reactions to it, which are discussed in Document 1. This document explains the conservative backlash against \"woke culture\" and how Sweeney's beauty is viewed as a challenge to those ideals. The phrase \"Boobs are back\" signifies a nostalgic return to traditional beauty standards, as highlighted in the meme. Document 0 is not directly relevant to the specific themes of beauty and \"woke\" culture as it addresses dialect and linguistic variations. Thus, the correct interpretation aligns with the sentiment in Document 1, making option A the best choice.",

    "reasoning": "The context provided in Document 0 outlines a debate around Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where her physical presentation is linked to a critique of \"wokeness.\" The meme's image caption of a woman talking on the phone can symbolize communication and social commentary, potentially indicating a discussion about beauty and societal norms. This correlates closely with option B, which discusses the endorsement of traditional beauty standards as a means of rejecting progressive values—a key theme in the document. Options A, C, and D either misinterpret or do not directly connect to the specific discourse around Sweeney's representation and the backlash against wokeness as highlighted in the oracle document.

    "reasoning": "The meme reflects the irony that while it celebrates Sydney Sweeney's beauty as a rejection of \"woke\" culture, it simultaneously highlights how societal standards of beauty can be manipulated for political commentary. This aligns closely with Document 1, which discusses how Sweeney's appearance has become a focal point for discussions on wokeness and beauty standards, portraying a tension between admiration and societal expectations. Document 0 is less relevant here as it pertains to a different topic entirely. Thus, the correct option is A, as it emphasizes the contradiction in praising beauty while rejecting the \"woke\" culture that critiques such admiration.",

Particularly, the commentary surrounding her appearance suggests that admiration of beauty is somehow counter to woke culture, which is a contradiction. This aligns with situational irony, where the reaction to her beauty is contrary to what one might expect from a culture that values diversity and inclusivity.

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The relevant document for this question is Document 1, which discusses the cultural implications of Sydney Sweeney's appearance and how it has sparked debates about beauty and 'woke' culture. The irony in the meme stems from the juxtaposition of celebrating Sweeney's beauty while simultaneously framing it as a critique of 'woke' standards. The options reflect different types of irony, but A is the most fitting because it captures the situational irony of claiming that beauty is a challenge to 'woke' culture, even though beauty is often celebrated within that same culture. Other options refer to forms of irony that do not align as closely with the meme's intent and context.",

    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme and understand the social conflict it depicts, Document 1 provides context about Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the surrounding debate over \"wokeness.\" It highlights how her visual presentation, specifically the emphasis on her cleavage, sparked discussions among conservatives who interpret it as a rejection of woke culture. This aligns with option D, where supporters of wokeness (those who advocate for modern social justice ideas) are contrasted against critics (like conservatives) who view her actions as a return to traditional values. Other options do not reflect the specific conflict presented in the documents. \n\nDocument 0 discusses a separate meme trend and is not relevant to the specific social groups in opposition depicted in the meme. Thus, the strongest conflict identified is indeed between D) Supporters of Wokeness vs. Critics of Wokeness.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** How does the image in the meme relate to the text of the accompanying document regarding Sydney Sweeney?\n\nA) It demonstrates that Sydney Sweeney is irrelevant to discussions of beauty in modern culture.  \nB) It illustrates a celebration of traditional beauty standards and critiques \"woke\" culture by showcasing admiration for Sweeney's appearance.  \nC) It argues that Sydney Sweeney's success is due to her acting skills rather than her physical appearance.  \nD) It suggests that Sydney Sweeney is a symbol of the decline of technological innovation in entertainment.",
    "reasoning": "The image features Sydney Sweeney smiling and celebrating, which complements the text that discusses her being a focal point in debates about beauty standards and the perceived death of \"woke\" culture. Document 1 provides context about how Sweeney's appearance sparked discussions that connect beauty with traditional values over modern \"woke\" sentiments. The meme emphasizes admiration for her beauty, aligning with the tone in the document that critiques the exclusion of beauty from cultural appreciation. Thus, option B is the most accurate in capturing this connection.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The context provided in Document 0 discusses Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the subsequent cultural commentary regarding beauty and wokeness. It highlights how Sweeney's beauty is being positioned as a challenge to \"woke culture,\" which has criticized admiration for physical beauty. The meme, therefore, reflects a perception that appreciating Sweeney's attractiveness is an act of defiance against societal norms promoted by \"woke\" ideologies. Document 1, however, discusses a separate topic related to demographic statistics and is not relevant to understanding the cultural context of the meme.

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The meme title directly references the sentiment expressed in the oracle document (Document ID 0), which argues that admiring Sydney Sweeney's beauty and her attire during her appearance on Saturday Night Live is a stance against \"wokeness.\" The article from the National Post supports the idea that appreciating beauty is somehow a rebellion against current social norms related to diversity and inclusion.

    "reasoning": "The meme plays on the notion that Sydney Sweeney's physical appearance, particularly her cleavage, is being framed as a challenge to \"woke\" culture. Document 0 discusses how her appearance sparked a debate on social media, with some arguing that admiring her beauty is an act against \"wokeness,\" which is a contradictory situation because traditional beauty standards are often critiqued by progressive movements. Thus, option A accurately reflects this irony. The other options do not align with the context of the meme or the discussions presented in Document 0.",

    "reasoning": "The meme references Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the surrounding discourse on her body and its cultural implications, as discussed in Document 0. It highlights the clash between conservative viewpoints that celebrate traditional beauty against a backdrop of \"woke\" culture, which is often perceived as critiquing such standards. Document 1 discusses racial intelligence theories, which are unrelated to the meme's context.

This highlights the ideological clash between conservative values that celebrate traditional beauty and liberal critiques of objectification and political correctness. Document 0, while discussing a different topic (the debunked theory of intelligence among racial groups), does not relate to the specific ideological conflict expressed in the meme.

    "reasoning": "The meme directly references Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the debate surrounding it as outlined in Document 0, which discusses how her cleavage and attractiveness have been framed as a counter to \"woke\" culture. The humor and critique in the meme relate closely to the sentiments expressed in the document regarding societal attitudes towards beauty and \"wokeness.\" Document 1, which discusses a different topic about historical inaccuracies related to race, is not relevant to the meme's context.

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "To analyze potential counterarguments to the meme, Document 1 provides context about the discussions surrounding Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the backlash against the notion that beauty can be anti-woke. Counterarguments might focus on how the objectification of women's bodies (Option A) undermines the values associated with equality and respect, which are foundational to the woke movement. Option C also presents a valid point that embracing diverse beauty standards can coexist with woke principles, directly countering the meme's premise. Options B and D, while potentially relevant, are less directly tied to the specific discourse highlighted in the meme and the documents. Therefore, the strongest counterarguments are represented in Options A and C.",

    "question_with_options": "### Question:\nWhat potential counterarguments exist to the perspective shown in the meme about Sydney Sweeney's appearance being a challenge to \"wokeness\"?\n\nA) The admiration of beauty should not be tied to political ideologies.  \nB) Wokeness promotes the appreciation of diverse body types.  \nC) The popularity of the meme indicates a shift in cultural norms.  \nD) Sydney Sweeney's beauty is irrelevant to discussions about social justice.\n\n### Answer:",
    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme's context, we reference Document 1, which discusses the backlash against \"wokeness\" and how Sweeney's appearance is framed as a counter to it. A valid counterargument to the meme's perspective is option A, which states that the admiration of beauty should not be conflated with political ideologies; it emphasizes that beauty can be appreciated without it being a critique of social movements. Option B also provides a counterargument by suggesting that wokeness itself encourages a broader appreciation of beauty beyond conventional standards. However, option D's assertion that her beauty is irrelevant to social justice is less directly related to the meme's focus on wokeness. Overall, option A encapsulates the most relevant counterargument found in the context of the meme’s discussion about beauty and wokeness.",

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left).

    "reasoning": "The meme appears to reference the broader cultural discourse surrounding Sydney Sweeney, particularly in how her appearance has been discussed in relation to \"wokeness.\" Document 1 discusses the backlash against \"woke culture\" and how Sweeney's attractiveness is being positioned as a challenge to those ideals, suggesting that beauty can stand against political correctness. The caption \"the world is a better place\" aligns with the sentiment that beauty and traditional values are being celebrated, which is reflected in the discussions from the document. The other options either misinterpret the context or focus on aspects not relevant to the overall message conveyed by the meme.",

    "reasoning": "The image and the accompanying text reflect a critique of perceived liberal control over cultural institutions, particularly through the lens of Sydney Sweeney's appearance at an event like the GLAAD Media Awards. This aligns with the sentiments expressed in Document 1, where conservatives discuss the implications of Sweeney's visibility and beauty as a challenge to \"woke\" culture. The context suggests that her presence is being used to argue that even institutions associated with diversity are losing their grip, which directly relates to option B. Options A, C, and D do not accurately represent the critique highlighted in the meme's context.",

    "reasoning": "The caption \"the world is a better place\" serves as a counterpoint to the ongoing debate about 'wokeness' and beauty as discussed in Document 1. The sentiment expressed in the meme aligns with the assertion in the document that admiration for Sydney Sweeney's beauty is a stand against 'woke' ideologies, thereby suggesting that beauty contributes positively to societal perceptions. This context supports option A as the most relevant interpretation of the phrase. Document 0, however, does not provide relevant insight into this specific metaphorical interpretation, while Document 1 provides a clear connection between beauty, anti-woke sentiment, and the cultural discourse surrounding Sweeney. Thus, option A is the best fit.",

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** How does the meme titled \"sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs_11\" use satire in its presentation?\n\nA) It critiques the negative perception of beauty in a \"woke\" society.  \nB) It supports the idea that beauty is subjective and not a political statement.  \nC) It humorously exaggerates the connection between admiration for beauty and the rejection of \"woke\" culture.  \nD) It presents an accurate portrayal of the societal impacts of \"woke\" culture.",
    "reasoning": "The context provided in Document 0 discusses a backlash against \"woke\" culture associated with Sydney Sweeney's appearance, focusing on how her beauty is framed as a critique of that culture. The meme caption, which states \"the world is a better place,\" aligns with the satirical element of the meme by suggesting that the admiration for Sweeney’s beauty can be seen as a rejection of \"woke\" ideologies. This indicates that the meme is using humor to exaggerate the connection between beauty and the notion of wokeness, making option C the most fitting answer. Other options either misinterpret the humor (A, B) or inaccurately represent the content of the meme (D). Thus, option C effectively captures the satirical nature of the meme.",

The document discusses how Sweeney's appearance has been used by some to argue against social justice ideas, especially in a way that is mocking and ironic. Option B captures this sentiment, highlighting that the meme suggests admiration for beauty is somehow a rebellion against progressive ideals, which is a satirical take on the discourse surrounding wokeness.

    "reasoning": "To analyze the structural inequality exposed by the meme, we can reference Document 1, which discusses the backlash against \"woke\" culture in relation to Sydney Sweeney's attractiveness. This document highlights how admiration for conventional beauty is positioned as a defiance against progressive values, effectively showcasing a conflict between traditional beauty standards (C) and contemporary social ideals. Document 0, while relevant to issues of racial identity, does not directly connect to the theme of beauty and societal values as seen in this meme. Therefore, option C accurately reflects the essence of the meme's commentary on societal perceptions of beauty versus modern values.",

Specifically, it highlights how admiration for Sweeney’s beauty is being framed as a stance against the \"woke\" agenda. The meme's visual of a woman holding a sign that states \"the world is a better place\" can be interpreted as supporting the idea that appreciating conventional beauty, like Sweeney's, is a positive reaction against wokeness.

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The meme's context is largely informed by Document 0, which discusses Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the notion that her beauty is used as a cultural commentary against \"woke\" ideology. This document illustrates how her representation ignites discussion about beauty standards and societal values, encouraging viewers to think critically about the implications of these narratives. The other document, Document 1, is irrelevant to the meme's thematic focus, as it discusses fabricated statistics on immigration rather than cultural commentary about beauty and \"wokeness.\" Therefore, option B is the most relevant and accurate interpretation of the meme's intent to provoke critical thought.",

    "reasoning": "The correct answer is B because the meme and its associated discourse encourage audiences to think critically about the societal implications of beauty standards and how they relate to contemporary debates about 'woke' culture. The document discussing Sydney Sweeney's appearance highlights how admiration for her beauty has been framed as an anti-woke stance, prompting discussions about what 'wokeness' means and how perceptions of beauty intersect with social ideologies. Options A, C, and D either misinterpret the meme's intent or focus on negative implications without considering the critical discussions that arise from it. Thus, B is the most accurate reflection of the meme's encouragement of critical thinking.",

Option B is the most relevant as it encourages examining the conflict between traditional and modern values, while the other options either oversimplify the discussion or reinforce stereotypes without promoting critical analysis.

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The meme and its associated context reflect a sentiment that admires traditional beauty as a form of resistance against what some perceive as \"woke\" culture. This is best supported by Document 1, which discusses the reaction to Sydney Sweeney's appearance and how it has been interpreted as a challenge to contemporary views on beauty and social standards. Document 0 does not provide relevant information regarding the specific cultural context of beauty versus \"wokeness.\" Thus, the correct answer is A, as it aligns with the meme's portrayal of beauty as a threat to modern social constructs.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What sentiment does the meme about Sydney Sweeney's appearance express regarding contemporary culture?\n\nA) It celebrates the return of traditional beauty standards in celebrity culture.  \nB) It critiques the lack of diversity in Hollywood.  \nC) It advocates for racial integration and harmony.  \nD) It dismisses the significance of personal appearance in public discourse.",
    "reasoning": "The correct option is A because the context provided in Document 0 highlights the perception among certain conservatives that Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the attention given to her beauty serve as a reaction against \"woke culture.\" The article from the National Post explicitly argues that appreciating Sweeney's beauty is a way to push back against the ideals promoted by diversity and inclusion advocates. This aligns with the sentiment expressed in the meme, reflecting a shared experience or perception among those who admire conventional beauty as defiance against current social norms. Document 1 is irrelevant here, as it discusses a different topic regarding racial integration without connection to the cultural critique of beauty standards.",

This aligns with the sentiment expressed in Document 0, which discusses how Sweeney's appearance has been interpreted as a challenge to contemporary social norms regarding beauty and attraction. Document 1, about \"Racial Harmony Quotient\" memes, is not relevant to this specific analysis, as it does not pertain to the themes of beauty or \"woke\" culture.

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left).

    "reasoning": "The meme utilizes the image of Sydney Sweeney alongside text that links her physical appearance to a critique of 'woke' culture, suggesting that admiration for beauty is a form of resistance against contemporary social norms. Document 1 discusses the sentiment surrounding Sweeney's appearance as an affront to 'woke culture,' thereby supporting the idea that beauty is being celebrated in defiance of these ideals. Document 0, while discussing a different meme trend, does not provide relevant context on beauty standards or 'woke' culture.

The document highlights that some viewers interpreted Sweeney's popularity as a rejection of 'woke' culture, suggesting a humorous or sarcastic critique of that sentiment.

    "reasoning": "The meme plays on the ongoing debate about beauty standards and \"woke\" culture, as discussed in Document 0. It uses exaggerated language, referring to Sweeney's physical attributes in a humorous and mocking way, suggesting that her appearance undermines the principles of wokeness. This aligns closely with option A, as the satirical nature lies in the critique of societal views on beauty and wokeness. The other options do not accurately reflect the content and tone of the meme. Document 1, which discusses a different meme format, is not relevant to this analysis.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** How does the meme titled \"sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\" reflect the dynamics of social status and power in contemporary discourse?\n\nA) It suggests that physical appearance can undermine established social movements.  \nB) It endorses diversity and inclusion by celebrating different body types.  \nC) It promotes the idea that beauty is subjective and should not be debated.  \nD) It implies that attention to physical attributes distracts from serious societal issues.",
    "reasoning": "The meme portrays Sydney Sweeney's physical appearance as a challenge to \"woke\" culture, suggesting that admiration for conventional beauty can counteract progressive movements. This aligns with the sentiments expressed in Document 1, where discussions around Sweeney's appearance led to debates about \"wokeness\" and beauty standards. Document 0, while discussing misconceptions about identity, does not directly relate to the power dynamics at play in this meme. Therefore, option A most accurately reflects how the meme relates to social status and power dynamics.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The meme directly references the backlash against 'woke' culture as noted in Document 0, which discusses how Sydney Sweeney's appearance was framed as an affront to progressive ideals. The commentary suggests that admiration for her beauty is positioned against 'wokeness', indicating a power struggle regarding societal standards of beauty and moral values. Document 1, while informative about internet trends, does not relate to the specific cultural critique presented in the meme.

    "reasoning": "The correct answer is B. The document (oracle) discusses Sydney Sweeney's appearance and how it sparked debates about beauty and \"woke\" culture, particularly in the National Post article that states, \"admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness.\" This aligns with the image's context of a woman in a dress, suggesting a celebration of beauty in defiance of current social norms. Options A and C are irrelevant as they do not pertain to the meme's context about Sweeney and \"woke\" culture. Option D, referring to hidden racial dynamics, is also a distractor and does not connect to the specific discussions about beauty and wokeness depicted in the meme.",

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media.

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left).

    "reasoning": "The meme references Sydney Sweeney's cleavage during her SNL appearance and the subsequent conservative commentary suggesting that her beauty is a counter to \"woke\" culture. Document 0 specifically discusses how her appearance was interpreted by some as a rejection of wokeness, with quotes from various users and an editorial that frames admiration of her beauty as a stance against current cultural norms. Thus, option A accurately reflects this viewpoint. The other options (B, C, D) contradict the central idea expressed in the meme and the associated document. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

Document 0 discusses how her appearance led to debates on social media regarding beauty standards and the concept of \"wokeness,\" indicating a modern context influenced heavily by social media and current cultural sentiments. The references to Twitter/X and the discussions surrounding beauty standards are very much reflective of contemporary culture. Document 1 is irrelevant as it discusses demographic changes and does not relate to cultural context or aesthetics.

The meme itself, featuring modern references and a collage of a contemporary figure in a bikini, aligns well with current social media trends and the ongoing discourse around beauty standards in the 2020s. \n\nDocument 0, while relevant to understanding racial stereotypes, does not directly pertain to the cultural reflection of the meme in question.

    "reasoning": "The meme leverages the visual elements of attractiveness, particularly in the context of Sydney Sweeney's appearance, which is discussed in Document 1. The document explains how her portrayal and the ensuing commentary are tied to a backlash against \"woke\" culture, suggesting that conventional beauty is seen as a challenge to modern social norms. This aligns with option B, indicating that the meme symbolizes the resurgence of traditional beauty as a counter to \"woke\" values.

    "reasoning": "The meme's caption and the context provided in Document 0 highlight a debate around Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the associated commentary about beauty and \"wokeness.\" The meme is likely satirical in nature, pointing out how some people view the admiration of Sweeney's beauty as a rejection of woke cultural norms, as discussed in the editorial from the National Post. This suggests that option A is the most relevant, as it aligns with the critique of beauty standards within the context of the meme. Options B and C introduce unrelated themes about race and conservative values, while option D, although it acknowledges a critique of media representation, does not directly capture the specific anti-woke sentiment prevalent in the discussion about Sweeney. Thus, option A is the best choice.",

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

Document 1, on the other hand, discusses fictional racial integration metrics, which is irrelevant to the meme's context. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left).

    "reasoning": "The meme interacts with the concept of beauty and societal perceptions, notably highlighted in Document 1, which discusses how Sydney Sweeney's attractiveness is framed as a challenge to 'woke' culture. The text in the meme emphasizes this by showcasing characters in a humorous context, reinforcing the idea that beauty can be seen as a form of resistance against contemporary cultural norms. Option B encapsulates this interaction effectively, making it the correct answer. Other options either misinterpret the meme or focus on aspects not directly represented in the documents.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** How does the image caption of a woman in a bikini relate to the discourse surrounding Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live regarding 'woke' culture?\n\nA) It directly critiques the concept of wokeness by showing that beauty can defy social norms.  \nB) It highlights the absurdity of using beauty standards as a measure of social progress.  \nC) It suggests that societal issues can be resolved through visual appeal and attractiveness.  \nD) It presents a humorous take on the backlash against 'woke' culture by juxtaposing beauty with social commentary.",
    "reasoning": "The context documents detail a situation where Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live was interpreted by some as a challenge to 'woke' culture, particularly through her emphasis on beauty. Document 0 discusses how admiration for Sweeney's beauty is framed as a rejection of 'woke' ideals, making option A the most relevant answer. The image caption of a woman in a bikini aligns with this narrative, as it visually represents beauty that some argue stands in opposition to 'woke' ideology. Therefore, option A is correct as it encapsulates the interaction between the visual elements (the bikini image) and the linguistic elements (the discourse on beauty and wokeness). Options B and C, while related to beauty, do not specifically address the connection to 'woke' culture as outlined in the documents. Option D, though humorous, does not directly reflect the underlying message as clearly as option A.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question: What viewpoint does the meme \"sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs_14\" present regarding societal standards of beauty and cultural values?**\n\nA) It promotes the idea that conventional beauty is irrelevant in today's society.  \nB) It suggests that admiration for beauty can be a rebellion against current cultural norms.  \nC) It argues that beauty standards are harmful and should be abolished.  \nD) It states that societal values have no relation to physical appearance.",
    "reasoning": "The meme appears to reference a broader discussion around beauty standards and cultural critiques, particularly in light of the documents provided. Document 0 highlights a debate sparked by Sydney Sweeney's appearance, where admiration for her beauty is framed as a challenge to \"woke\" culture. This sentiment aligns with option B, as it suggests that appreciating beauty is a form of resistance against prevailing cultural values. Document 1, while discussing immigrant assimilation, is unrelated to the thematic focus of beauty and societal norms addressed in the meme. Therefore, the most relevant document is Document 0, which supports the viewpoint that admiration for beauty is an act of defiance against current cultural standards.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question: What argument does the meme \"sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs_14\" primarily support regarding Sydney Sweeney's public appearance?**\n\nA) It promotes the idea that beauty should not be admired in modern society.  \nB) It suggests that Sydney Sweeney's attractiveness is a rejection of 'woke' culture.  \nC) It argues that wokeness is irrelevant to contemporary social issues.  \nD) It claims that attractiveness is inherently linked to racial expression.",
    "reasoning": "The meme context relates to Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was interpreted by some as a statement against 'woke' culture, particularly emphasizing her beauty and how it supposedly contradicts the values of diversity and inclusion. Document 0 discusses how Sweeney's appearance led to discussions about beauty and wokeness, specifically highlighting the sentiment that admiring her beauty can be seen as a stance against wokeness. This directly supports option B. Document 1 is irrelevant as it discusses a fictional scale related to ethnic expression, which does not pertain to the arguments around Sweeney's appearance or societal commentary. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",

    "reasoning": "The relevant document for understanding the cultural context of the meme is Document 1, which discusses Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live and the subsequent online sentiment around her \"anti-woke\" stance. This reflects the culture of the Modern Era, particularly the 2020s, where discussions around \"wokeness\" and beauty standards are prevalent. The meme illustrates a reaction to contemporary social issues, making option C the most accurate. The other options (A, B, and D) do not pertain to the current cultural climate discussed in the documents. Therefore, the correct choice is C.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media.

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter.

    "reasoning": "The meme references Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the ensuing debates surrounding her perceived defiance of \"woke\" culture. Document 0 discusses how her physical appearance became a focal point for discussions about beauty, societal norms, and conservative reactions, suggesting that her conventional attractiveness challenges modern \"woke\" ideals. This aligns with option B, which reflects the resurgence of conservative values that the meme seems to be advocating. Option A misinterprets the focus on beauty standards, option C is more about gender issues which aren't the main focus of the meme, and option D, while relevant to celebrity culture, does not capture the essence of the \"anti-woke\" sentiment expressed. Thus, the most fitting metaphorical concept is the resurgence of conservative values through admiration of traditional beauty.",

Options A and D both touch on themes of beauty and wokeness, but A is more accurate as it mentions the celebration of beauty contrasting with criticisms, capturing the essence of the meme.

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The meme is centered around the public discourse regarding Sydney Sweeney's appearance and how it relates to the concept of \"wokeness.\" Document 1 discusses the sentiment among conservatives that Sweeney's beauty and her attire during her SNL appearance symbolize a rejection of \"woke\" culture, creating a substantial debate online about beauty standards and societal expectations. This ties directly to option A, which reflects the conflict over beauty standards. Option B is relevant but not as directly connected as A. Option C also touches on celebrity culture but is less about the core conflict. Option D is completely unrelated to the meme's focus on societal debates around beauty and wokeness. \n\nThus, option A best encapsulates the social conflict depicted in the meme.",

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media.

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter.

    "reasoning": "The meme's caption references Sydney Sweeney and the associated discourse about beauty and wokeness, as described in Document 1. The visual element of a man in a suit reading a book contrasts with the sensationalized content surrounding Sweeney's appearance. Option A suggests he critiques the sensationalism, which aligns with the intellectual tone implied in the meme. Option B hints at a celebration of beauty, which is also present in the discussions but doesn't directly relate to the visual element. Option C suggests confusion, which is less relevant as the meme likely reflects a more critical stance. Option D implies indifference, which is contrary to the active engagement in the debate. Therefore, the best answer is A, as it encapsulates the critique of sensationalism versus intellectual discourse.",

    "reasoning": "The relevant document is Document 1, which discusses the cultural discourse surrounding Sydney Sweeney and how her appearance has been interpreted in the context of \"woke\" culture. The meme's visual and linguistic elements interact to create humor and critique, reflecting how beauty is perceived in society and the backlash against certain cultural norms. The other options either misinterpret the meme's intent or bring in unrelated topics, such as racial issues, which are not present in this context. Therefore, option B correctly highlights how the caption presents a contradiction to the visual representation.",

    "reasoning": "The relevant oracle document (Document 0) details the online discourse surrounding Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live and how it has been interpreted as a challenge to \"woke\" culture. Specifically, the article in the National Post argues that appreciating Sweeney's beauty counters the ideals promoted by woke culture, suggesting that admiration of beauty is indeed a stance against it. The other document (Document 1) discusses a separate topic unrelated to beauty or wokeness, making it a distractor. Therefore, option B is the correct interpretation of the meme.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What viewpoint does the meme titled \"Sydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs\" convey regarding societal perceptions of beauty and \"wokeness\"?\n\nA) It argues that traditional beauty standards are being upheld against \"woke\" culture.\n\nB) It suggests that all beauty standards should be rejected in favor of inclusivity.\n\nC) It promotes the idea that \"wokeness\" is irrelevant in contemporary society.\n\nD) It claims that appreciating beauty is inherently problematic and should be condemned.",
    "reasoning": "The meme's title directly references Sydney Sweeney and her portrayal of beauty, as discussed in Document 0, which highlights a sentiment among conservatives that her appearance symbolizes a rejection of \"woke\" ideals. The article from the National Post argues that celebrating Sweeney's beauty counters the criticisms of beauty standards imposed by \"woke\" culture, making option A the most relevant viewpoint. Option B contradicts the meme's premise, while C and D do not accurately reflect the debate surrounding Sweeney's portrayal. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media.

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter.

This reflects situational irony, as the expectation of supporting inclusivity contrasts with the glorification of beauty that is deemed exclusionary.

    "reasoning": "The meme directly addresses the debate surrounding Sydney Sweeney's attractiveness and how some attribute her appeal to a perceived decline of \"wokeness,\" which is discussed in Document 0. This document explains how her appearance has been used to argue against \"woke\" culture, reflecting a conservative perspective. The key irony here is that Sweeney’s beauty is framed as a challenge to wokeness, despite the notion that beauty should be celebrated regardless of cultural trends. Therefore, the correct choice is C, as it encapsulates the contradiction in attributing societal shifts to individual attractiveness. Document 1 is not relevant to this meme's context as it discusses a different topic entirely.",

This is reflected in Document 0, which outlines how the admiration of Sydney Sweeney's beauty is argued to be a challenge to wokeness, igniting social media debates. The caption in the meme also denies that her attractiveness equates to the \"death of woke,\" highlighting the conflict between traditional beauty standards and modern societal values. Document 1 discusses a different topic regarding intelligence and race, making it irrelevant to the meme's context. Therefore, the most pertinent option is A, as it encapsulates the core tension between beauty standards and societal values.",

    "reasoning": "The image shows Sydney Sweeney with a caption stating that her attractiveness does not signify the \"death of woke.\" This directly aligns with the sentiment discussed in Document 1, which highlights how some conservative commentators view Sweeney's appearance as a reaction against \"wokeness.\" However, the meme counters that perspective, emphasizing that admiration for beauty can exist independently of political implications. Therefore, the correct option is B, as it accurately represents the message of the meme. Options A, C, and D misinterpret the meme's intent or overgeneralize its implications. Document 0 does not pertain to the meme's context, as it focuses on ancestry challenges rather than discussions around wokeness and beauty.",

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

The editorial piece discussed in that document argues that appreciating Sweeney's conventional attractiveness is a stance against wokeness, highlighting how beauty standards are often criticized by contemporary cultural movements. Document 1, on the other hand, focuses on an unrelated concept of racial authenticity, which does not apply to this meme's context.

The phrase \"wokeness is dead\" in the discussions surrounding her appearance further reinforces that her beauty is being positioned as a counter-narrative to the ideals associated with woke culture.

This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left).

Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media.

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter.

Document 1 discusses how Sweeney's portrayal in a popular media context led to discussions about \"wokeness\" and societal expectations surrounding beauty. The meme contrasts two types of beauty in a humorous way, aligning closely with option B, which addresses the absurdity of social commentary about women's bodies, reflecting the tone of satire present in the meme.

    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs_17\" references Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live and the ensuing discourse regarding her beauty and its implications against \"wokeness.\" Document 0 discusses how Sweeney's cleavage during her performance was interpreted by some as a symbol of the decline of woke culture, particularly in relation to beauty standards and admiration for conventional attractiveness. This aligns closely with option B, which points to the backlash against perceived wokeness. The other options, while related to broader social discussions, do not specifically address the mockery directed at the backlash against wokeness, making B the best choice.

    "reasoning": "To analyze the social conflict in the meme, we refer to Document 0, which discusses Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the subsequent backlash and praise surrounding it. The document indicates that conservatives view her portrayal as a rejection of \"woke\" culture, leading to a division between those who support traditional beauty standards and those who criticize such views as exclusionary or regressive, often associated with progressive ideals. Document 1, which discusses dialect origins and racial groups, is irrelevant to the core conflict presented in this meme. Thus, the most relevant opposition in this context is between conservatives and progressives. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

    "reasoning": "The meme juxtaposes two images of women with different breast sizes and poses a question about male preferences, indicating a debate over societal beauty standards and preferences. This aligns with the sentiments expressed in Document 1, where Sydney Sweeney's appearance is tied to broader discussions about beauty and \"wokeness.\" The editorial content in Document 1 reflects on how admiration of beauty can be seen as a rejection of \"woke\" culture. Therefore, option C, which suggests an endorsement of conservative values through the admiration of physical attributes, captures the essence of the meme as it relates to the discussions in the document. The other options do not fully encompass this aspect or are less relevant to the context provided.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What is the primary message conveyed in the meme titled \"sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\" based on the image caption and the accompanying text?\n\nA) The meme promotes the idea that beauty should be celebrated regardless of societal pressures from \"woke\" culture.  \nB) The meme criticizes Sydney Sweeney's choice of outfit during her SNL appearance.  \nC) The meme argues that \"wokeness\" is overrated and should be disregarded completely.  \nD) The meme highlights the importance of diversity and inclusion in media representation.",
    "reasoning": "The relevant document here is Document 1, which delves into the backlash against \"woke\" culture through the lens of Sydney Sweeney's appearance on SNL and how her beauty is positioned as a counter to this culture. The article suggests that admiration for Sweeney's looks is a rejection of \"woke\" ideologies, which fits closely with option A. Options B and D do not align with the overall theme of the meme as expressed in the document, as they either misinterpret the sentiment or divert from the central message. Option C, while partially relevant, does not encapsulate the celebration of beauty as the main message of the meme. Thus, the best answer is A.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The meme's text contrasts two different body types—small-breasted versus large-breasted women—and presents a dichotomy for men to choose between them. This aligns with the sentiments expressed in Document 0, which discusses the social media reaction to Sydney Sweeney's appearance and how her large breasts were framed as a challenge to \"woke\" ideals. The meme leverages this cultural commentary to provoke thought on beauty standards and preferences. Document 1 is not relevant as it discusses a different topic concerning racial identity and visual tests.

This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts.

    "reasoning": "The meme references Sydney Sweeney's physical appearance in a way that highlights societal preferences for body types, particularly in relation to the concept of \"wokeness.\" Document 1 discusses how Sydney Sweeney's appearance sparked a debate about beauty standards and societal expectations, which aligns with option A regarding the objectification of women's bodies in media. Option C also relates to the meme's context by addressing the notion of wokeness as it pertains to societal norms around beauty. However, the primary focus of the meme appears to critique the societal tendency to objectify women based on their physical attributes, making A the most relevant. Document 0 discusses a different topic entirely, making it a distractor. Therefore, the best answer is A.",

    "reasoning": "The meme in question is related to Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the commentary surrounding it, suggesting that admiration for her beauty is a stance against \"woke\" culture. This aligns with the sentiments expressed in Document 0, which discusses how Sweeney's beauty has been used to critique modern cultural norms about beauty and desirability. The meme reflects a sentiment that traditional beauty is being celebrated in opposition to the values associated with wokeness, suggesting that A is the most accurate interpretation. Document 1, which discusses demographic predictions, is not relevant to this cultural context. \n\nThus, the correct answer is A, as it captures the essence of the meme's commentary on beauty and social movements.",

    "reasoning": "The meme reflects a shared perception that beauty, particularly as represented by figures like Sydney Sweeney, is often artificially enhanced by makeup, which leads to unrealistic standards. This aligns with the discussions in Document 0, where Sweeney's appearance is discussed in the context of societal expectations and reactions to \"wokeness.\" The other options either contradict the meme's implication about beauty standards or don't relate to the context provided in the documents. Document 1 is not relevant as it discusses a different topic altogether.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What social message is conveyed through the symbolic elements of the meme depicting Sydney Sweeney?\n\nA) The idea that beauty and attractiveness are subjective and should not be judged.\n\nB) A critique of societal standards that equate beauty with worth, particularly in the context of \"woke\" culture.\n\nC) An endorsement of the natural appearance of women, suggesting they should not rely on makeup.\n\nD) A humorous take on the contrast between public personas and private appearances.",
    "reasoning": "The meme relates to the social discourse surrounding beauty standards and \"woke\" culture, as highlighted in Document 1, which discusses Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the reactions it garnered. The document mentions that admiration for Sweeney's beauty is framed as a stance against \"wokeness,\" which is relevant to option B. While option D may also seem relevant, it doesn't capture the deeper critique of societal beauty standards as discussed in the document. Thus, the most appropriate answer is B, as it aligns directly with the critique of beauty standards in the context of the meme's discourse.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

The sentiment is that admiration for her beauty is used as a symbol against 'wokeness'.

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The relevant document to understand this meme is Document ID 1, which outlines the social media discourse surrounding Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the backlash against \"woke\" culture. The meme employs satire by juxtaposing Sweeney's physical appearance with the perceived absurdity of the arguments made about beauty and wokeness, especially in the context of the editorial that argued her beauty contradicts wokeness. Options A and D suggest a more straightforward promotion of beauty, while B does not fully capture the specific context of the meme. Option C effectively highlights the tension between beauty standards and social media discourse, which is central to the meme's satirical nature. Therefore, the best answer is C.",

    "reasoning": "The meme plays on the contrast between Sydney Sweeney's made-up appearance and her appearance without makeup, using humor to critique societal standards of beauty and masculinity. Document 1 discusses Sydney Sweeney's representation in media and the backlash against beauty standards, which aligns with option B. The exaggerated comparison in the meme reflects a satirical take on expectations of women in society. Options A and C are somewhat relevant but do not capture the core irony as effectively as B. Option D is not applicable to the meme's content, as it does not promote a political agenda. Thus, option B is the most fitting answer regarding the meme's satirical elements.",

    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme's social conflict, we refer primarily to Document 0, which discusses the controversy surrounding Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live and the subsequent conservative framing of her beauty as a challenge to \"woke\" culture. The meme's title, \"sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs,\" directly indicates a connection to this conflict, as it implies that Sweeney's physical appearance is being weaponized against progressive ideals. This resonates strongly with option C, which articulates the tension between conservative values and \"woke\" culture. \n\nDocument 1, while mentioning a meme format, does not provide relevant context for understanding the specific social conflict presented in the meme about Sweeney. Therefore, it is less useful for this analysis. \n\nThus, the most relevant option that captures the essence of the meme's social conflict is C.",

    "reasoning": "The meme reflects a tension surrounding societal beauty standards and the backlash against 'woke' culture, particularly as highlighted in Document 0. This document discusses how Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the admiration for her traditional beauty challenge the 'woke' sentiment regarding beauty standards. Document 1, on the other hand, is unrelated to this specific conflict as it discusses dialects and racial groups, which does not connect to the meme's focus. Therefore, the correct option is A.",

This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts.

We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter.

The linguistic element critiques those who have not \"woken up next to a woman,\" suggesting that the commenter’s perspective is limited or uninformed. Option C best encapsulates the overall tone of the meme, as it mocks the superficiality of judging a woman's worth based solely on her physical appearance.

    "reasoning": "The relevant oracle document is Document 1, which discusses the cultural debate surrounding Sydney Sweeney's appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" and how her beauty is perceived as a challenge to woke culture. The meme likely plays on this sentiment, using the visual of a woman with a man’s face to symbolize a clash between traditional beauty and contemporary notions of wokeness. Option B accurately captures this interaction by suggesting that her attractiveness is being positioned as opposition to wokeness. Options A, C, and D do not align with the context provided in the documents, making them distractors.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** How does the meme titled \"sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs_18\" reflect societal attitudes towards beauty standards and \"woke\" culture?\n\nA. It promotes the idea that beauty is subjective and not tied to societal expectations.  \nB. It suggests that a woman's worth is tied to her physical appearance, dismissing the impact of \"woke\" culture.  \nC. It highlights the importance of makeup in defining beauty and reinforces traditional beauty standards.  \nD. It critiques the superficiality of beauty standards while supporting \"woke\" culture.",
    "reasoning": "The meme utilizes the image of Sydney Sweeney to juxtapose societal attitudes towards beauty, particularly in relation to \"woke\" culture. Document 1 discusses how Sydney Sweeney's appearance and beauty have been framed as a rejection of \"woke\" ideals, suggesting that admiration for her beauty signifies a challenge to these societal norms. The commentary in the meme reflects a similar sentiment, indicating that the perception of beauty remains influential in discussions about societal values. Thus, option B captures the essence of how the meme portrays the relationship between beauty and cultural commentary. Options A, C, and D do not accurately reflect the critique presented in the documents.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The popularity of the meme is directly linked to a conservative reaction to \"woke\" culture, particularly in how Sydney Sweeney's appearance was framed as a challenge to the ideals of that culture. Document 0 discusses how Sweeney’s outfits during her SNL appearance sparked debates among conservatives, who interpreted her portrayal as a rejection of \"wokeness.\" The commentary surrounding her beauty and its celebration is positioned against the backdrop of critiques of modern beauty standards imposed by \"woke\" ideologies. Document 1 is unrelated to this specific context, as it focuses on demographic predictions and does not address the cultural implications of beauty or \"wokeness.\" Therefore, option B accurately captures the social background relevant to the meme's popularity.",

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The meme references Sydney Sweeney's appearance, which has sparked discussions about \"wokeness\" and beauty standards. Document 0 explains how Sweeney's portrayal in media has been interpreted as an opposition to \"wokeness,\" suggesting that admiring her beauty is a stance against progressive values. This aligns with option A, which captures the essence of the metaphor that valuing conventional beauty contradicts the ideals of inclusivity often associated with \"woke\" culture. Document 1, which discusses a fictional scale of ethnic expression, is not relevant to this specific meme's context. Therefore, the most fitting interpretation of the metaphor is option A.",

    "reasoning": "The meme is directly tied to the discussions surrounding Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the conservative backlash against \"woke\" culture, as detailed in Document 0. The sentiment expressed in the meme suggests that admiration for Sweeney's beauty is being used to challenge or dismiss progressive ideals, a point highlighted in the articles discussing her impact on discussions of beauty and wokeness. Document 1 does not relate to the social phenomenon depicted in the meme, as it concerns facial recognition technology rather than cultural commentary. Therefore, the correct answer is A, which aligns with the mocking of the notion that beauty cannot coexist with progressive values.",

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

Document 0 discusses a different meme series that falsely claims to measure 'racial authenticity,' which is not directly related to the meme in question.

This document discusses Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the subsequent reactions, particularly from conservative circles who argue that her beauty symbolizes a defiance against 'woke' culture. The caption in the meme, \"the world is a better place,\" aligns with the sentiment expressed in Document 0 that beauty (as exemplified by Sweeney) is something to be admired, and that this admiration contradicts the criticisms of 'wokeness'.

    "reasoning": "The relevant document here is Document 1, which discusses the backlash against \"wokeness\" in the context of Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live. It indicates that her conventional attractiveness is seen as a challenge to the ideals of \"woke\" culture. The meme's caption and the visual element of the woman holding a sign saying \"the world is a better place\" suggest a celebration or endorsement of traditional beauty. Therefore, option B accurately reflects the interaction between the visual and linguistic elements by highlighting the idea that the meme critiques \"woke\" culture through the lens of conventional beauty.

    "reasoning": "The meme focuses on the juxtaposition of Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the commentary around it, suggesting that her beauty is being positioned as a rejection of 'wokeness.' This aligns with the sentiments expressed in Document 0, which discusses how Sweeney's attractiveness has been framed as a counter to woke culture. The option A is the most relevant as it reflects the sentiment of the meme, where admiration of beauty is linked to an anti-woke stance. Other options either misinterpret the context or do not relate directly to the meme's focus on beauty and wokeness. Therefore, A is the most appropriate choice.",

This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media.

She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter.

    "reasoning": "The correct answer is B, as the documents clearly outline a sentiment among some conservatives that Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the admiration of her beauty symbolize a rejection of \"woke culture.\" Document 1 discusses how her portrayal on \"Saturday Night Live\" and subsequent reactions were framed as a challenge to political correctness, linking beauty with a stance against wokeness. Document 0, while discussing a different meme, illustrates the ongoing dialogue about race and expression, but does not directly relate to the specific cultural context of the Sydney Sweeney meme. Thus, the context of backlash against wokeness and a celebration of beauty in the meme's narrative is best captured by option B.",

    "reasoning": "Document 1 provides insight into the sentiment surrounding Sydney Sweeney's appearance, specifically how her portrayal and the subsequent reaction on social media were interpreted as a challenge to \"woke culture.\" The meme's context is heavily tied to discussions of beauty and how it relates to societal norms and criticisms of wokeness. The other options (B, C, D) either do not relate to the specific interactions and sentiments surrounding this meme or are irrelevant to the meme's context of beauty and anti-woke sentiment.

On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "Document 1 (about Sydney Sweeney's appearance) discusses the backlash against \"woke\" culture and how admiration for beauty is framed as an anti-woke sentiment. It highlights that while some criticize the admiration of beauty, others celebrate it as a form of resistance. This creates a clear irony: praising beauty while simultaneously criticizing the social norms that discourage such admiration. Other options either misinterpret the context or fail to address the irony present in the meme itself.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A, as it captures the essence of the irony in the context of the meme and the discourse surrounding Sweeney's appearance.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What type of irony is illustrated by the meme featuring a woman in a bikini with a sign, in the context of Sydney Sweeney's anti-woke backlash?\n\nA) Verbal irony, where the caption suggests the opposite of what is meant.  \nB) Situational irony, where the outcome is contrary to what was expected.  \nC) Dramatic irony, where the audience knows something that the characters do not.  \nD) Cosmic irony, where fate plays a cruel joke on human aspirations.",
    "reasoning": "The meme features a woman in a bikini alongside a sign, which satirizes the conservative backlash against Sydney Sweeney's appearance on Saturday Night Live, as detailed in Document 1. This backlash claims that her conventional attractiveness signifies a rejection of \"woke\" culture, creating a humorous contradiction between the intent of the 'anti-woke' sentiment and the celebration of beauty, which is typically valued in society. This situation is best categorized as situational irony, as the expectation that beauty should be condemned within a 'woke' framework is subverted by the admiration it garners. Document 0, which discusses the popularity of the 'Cultural Inversion' meme format, is less relevant here. Therefore, the best answer is B) Situational irony.",

    "reasoning": "To analyze the social conflict in the meme titled \"Sydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs,\" we refer primarily to Document 1. This document details how Sydney Sweeney's appearance has sparked a debate between conservatives, who view her as a symbol against \"woke culture,\" and liberals or advocates of diversity and inclusion, who may criticize the objectification of women and the implications of beauty standards. The editorial in the National Post that praises Sweeney's beauty as a stance against wokeness highlights this opposition. Therefore, the correct answer that identifies the opposing social groups is A) Conservatives vs. liberals. Other options do not accurately capture the essence of the conflict presented in the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What does the meme about Sydney Sweeney's appearance and the accompanying text suggest about societal perceptions of beauty and \"woke\" culture?\n\nA) It highlights the celebration of diversity in beauty standards.  \nB) It suggests that traditional notions of beauty are being challenged by \"woke\" culture.  \nC) It implies that admiration for beauty contradicts woke ideals and signals a backlash against them.  \nD) It indicates that discussions about beauty are irrelevant in today's society.",
    "reasoning": "The meme features Sydney Sweeney, linking her appearance to a broader commentary on beauty and \"woke\" culture, as discussed in Document 1. The text implies that recognizing and admiring conventional beauty, particularly in the context of Sweeney’s recent media appearance, is positioned as an act against \"wokeness.\" This aligns with the sentiments expressed in Document 1, which discusses how admiration for Sweeney's beauty has been framed as a rejection of contemporary diversity and inclusion narratives. Thus, option C correctly captures the relationship between the meme and the societal commentary it presents. Options A, B, and D do not accurately reflect the implications drawn in the context of the meme.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What is the relationship between the text \"sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\" and the image caption of a woman in a bikini holding a sign in the meme?\n\nA) The image represents a celebration of woke culture.  \nB) The text refers to a backlash against traditional beauty standards, while the image showcases conventional attractiveness.  \nC) The image depicts Sydney Sweeney promoting anti-woke sentiments through her appearance.  \nD) The text and image are unrelated, as they come from different contexts.",
    "reasoning": "The text \"sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\" connects directly to the discussions in Document 1 about Sydney Sweeney's appearance and how it has been interpreted as a statement against \"woke\" culture. The image caption describes a woman in a bikini, which aligns with the theme of emphasizing beauty, as discussed in the context of Sweeney's appearance and the societal debates surrounding it. Therefore, option C is correct since it captures the essence of how Sweeney's physical representation in the media is tied to anti-woke sentiments. Other options misinterpret this relationship or do not relate to the context provided in the documents.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

    "reasoning": "The meme references Sydney Sweeney's appearance and how it has sparked debate regarding societal perceptions of beauty and \"wokeness,\" as outlined in Document 1. This document highlights how Sweeney's portrayal can provoke discussions about beauty standards and their implications in a \"woke\" context. Option A is relevant as it discusses beauty as a political issue, while option B encourages critical examination of media's influence on societal values. Option C reinforces stereotypes rather than encouraging critical thought, and option D simplifies the concept of \"wokeness\" without deeper analysis. Therefore, option B is the best choice as it directly relates to critical thinking about media and societal values.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** How does the meme titled \"sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\" provoke critical thinking regarding social norms and cultural perceptions?\n\nA) It presents fabricated statistics about immigrant assimilation rates to mislead the audience.  \nB) It critiques the cultural pressures around beauty and the backlash against \"woke\" ideologies through the lens of Sydney Sweeney's appearance.  \nC) It solely focuses on Sydney Sweeney's career and does not engage with social issues.  \nD) It promotes a simplistic view that beauty is inherently linked to political ideologies without deeper analysis.",
    "reasoning": "The correct answer is B because the meme discusses Sydney Sweeney's appearance in a way that critiques cultural dynamics surrounding beauty and \"woke\" ideologies, as explained in Document 1. This document details how Sweeney’s appearance has sparked debate regarding societal standards and perceptions of beauty, making audiences reflect on these cultural pressures. Option A is irrelevant as it pertains to a different subject (immigrant statistics), while C dismisses the social critique involved, and D oversimplifies the meme's commentary on political ideologies tied to beauty. Thus, options A, C, and D are distractors, while B directly aligns with the meme's purpose and context.",

    "oracle_doc": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",

        "content": "sydney-sweeneys-anti-woke-boobs\n\nAbout\nSydney Sweeney's Anti-Woke Boobs refers to a sentiment among some conservatives online that actress Sydney Sweeney's March 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she notably wore outfits that emphasized her cleavage, was somehow an affront to woke culture. This sentiment led to an editorial in Canada's National Post, leading to jokes and debate online.\nOrigin\nOn March 3rd, 2023, Sydney Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode notably featured several skits centered around Sweeney's breasts. Following the show, Twitter / X user @RichardHanania[1] posted a clip of Sweeney from the end of the show, with her in a dress that prominently features her cleavage, writing, \"wokeness is dead.\" The tweet gained over 6,300 retweets and 57,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nSpread\nLater on March 3rd, 2024, Ian Miles Cheong echoed @RichardHanania's sentiment, tweeting both the Sweeney video and a video of a carpenter doing ceiling installation, arguing that because the videos were popular on TikTok and X at the time, wokeness was dead.[3] The tweet gained over 3,500 retweets and 48,000 likes in four days (shown below).\nThe sentiment inspired confusion and debate on social media. On March 4th, 2024, Twitter user @waco_warren[2] quote tweeted RichardHanania, asking, \"I’m genuinely curious as to what woke means to white people lol,\" gaining over 7,500 retweets and 118,000 likes in three days (shown below, top).\nOn March 6th, writer Amy Hamm of the National Post[4] published an article arguing that \"Wokeness is no match for Sydney Sweeney's undeniable beauty.\" In the article, she argues that admiring Sweeney's conventional attractiveness amounts to a stance against wokeness. She writes:\nWe’ve spent years being chastised for desiring or admiring beauty -- because beauty is rare and exclusionary, and to exclude is to hate -- or so we’ve been scolded to accept by today’s diversity, equity, and inclusion fanatics. We aren’t supposed to admire Sweeney’s beauty; but we’ve done it anyways.\nThe piece also quotes Jordan Peterson's much-memed Sorry, Not Beautiful tweet and defended him as an \"unrepentant thought criminal\" and the recent wave of Sweeney praise amounts to validation of his point.\nThe piece was widely mocked on Twitter. On March 6th, Twitter user @DavidDoel[5] screenshot the piece's first line – \"Are Sydney Sweeney’s breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\" – in mockery, gaining over 2,400 retweets and 30,000 likes in one day (shown below, left). User @UweBollocks[6] quote-tweeted the National Post article saying, \"Big fat honkers made me racist,\" gaining over 20 retweets and 520 likes in one day (shown below, right).",
