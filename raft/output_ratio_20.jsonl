    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What cultural phenomenon does the meme \"One does not simply ignore Karen memes\" reference?\n\nA) The rise of social media influencers  \nB) The stereotype of entitled behavior exhibited by certain individuals, particularly women, often referred to as \"Karen\"  \nC) The popularity of fantasy film franchises  \nD) The impact of viral video culture on social interactions",
    "reasoning": "The meme references the cultural phenomenon surrounding the \"Karen\" character, which is characterized by entitlement and irritating behavior, particularly in contexts involving social justice issues. Document 2 discusses the origin and spread of the \"Karen\" meme, detailing its connection to public incidents and stereotypes that have emerged in popular culture. The other documents (0, 1, and 3) are distractors that do not provide relevant information about the cultural context of the meme. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.",
    "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: B",
    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme \"karen_2,\" indicated by its title and image caption which features a man talking on a cell phone, suggests a connection to the broader cultural phenomenon surrounding the \"Karen\" character. Document 0 extensively describes \"Karen\" as a pejorative term used to depict an entitled and often irritating woman, especially in the context of social conflicts, particularly those involving race.

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme references the \"Karen\" phenomenon, which is characterized by the portrayal of entitled and often problematic behavior attributed to women named Karen. Document 2 provides a thorough explanation of the origins and spread of the \"Karen\" meme, detailing how it has come to symbolize certain negative behaviors, particularly in public interactions. The other documents are distractors and do not directly relate to the \"Karen\" cultural phenomenon. Therefore, the correct answer is option B, as it directly addresses the essence of the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The most relevant document is Document 2, which explains the character \"Karen\" as a symbol of entitlement and irritation, particularly in social situations. The image caption of a man talking on a cell phone suggests he might be discussing a frustrating encounter with a \"Karen,\" which aligns with the context of the meme. The other options do not connect to the \"Karen\" theme as closely, making option B the best choice.",
    "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: B",
    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

[1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The context of the meme references the \"Karen\" character, which is explored in Document 2. This document outlines how \"Karen\" has become a symbol of entitlement and annoyance within social contexts, suggesting that such memes are significant and cannot be easily ignored. The phrase in the meme implies that dismissing these memes may be a mistake, aligning with option C, which indicates that they represent a significant cultural issue. The other options do not accurately reflect the document's exploration of the societal implications of Karen memes. Therefore, the correct interpretation is option C.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme uses the phrase \"One does not simply ignore Karen memes,\" which is a humorous twist on the serious tone of the original scene from \"The Lord of the Rings.\" This juxtaposition highlights the absurdity and ubiquity of \"Karen\" memes in popular culture, effectively mocking the stereotype associated with the character. Document 1 is relevant as it explains the origins and spread of the \"Karen\" meme, further emphasizing how it is used to critique certain societal behaviors. The other documents are distractors and do not provide relevant context for understanding the meme's satirical nature.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** In what way does the meme titled \"karen_2,\" which features a man talking on a cell phone, incorporate satirical elements?\n\nA) It mocks the stereotype of men who talk loudly on their phones in public.  \nB) It highlights the absurdity of the \"Karen\" phenomenon by suggesting even ordinary situations can escalate.  \nC) It critiques the use of cell phones as a modern distraction in social interactions.  \nD) It implies that all conversations on cell phones are unnecessary and annoying.",
    "reasoning": "The meme context refers to the term \"Karen,\" which is characterized as an entitled and irritating figure often depicted in memes, particularly in situations where they demand to speak to a manager or escalate minor issues. This aligns with the satirical nature of the meme, suggesting that even mundane interactions, such as a man speaking on a cellphone, could spiral into a \"Karen\"-like confrontation. Document 0 provides a comprehensive overview of the \"Karen\" meme and its implications, making it relevant for understanding how the meme incorporates satire. The other distractor documents (1, 2, 3) do not provide pertinent information to analyze the satirical aspects of this meme. Thus, option B is the most accurate answer.",

    "reasoning": "The meme uses a well-known format to address the prevalence and absurdity of \"Karen\" memes, which often involve entitled behavior and trivial complaints, as discussed in Document 2. This document defines \"Karen\" as an antagonistic character often depicted in memes, highlighting her irritating and entitled nature. Option A directly relates to this, as it captures the essence of the satire by suggesting that the behavior of \"Karens\" is comically overblown and should not be ignored. Options B and C do not align with the satirical tone of the meme, and D contradicts the ironic commentary that memes like this aim to provide.

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme references the concept of \"Karen,\" which is characterized as an irritating, entitled woman often depicted in opposition to marginalized groups, particularly in contexts where she exhibits discriminatory behavior. Document 1 discusses the origins and implications of the \"Karen\" character, highlighting its association with white women who have been filmed harassing people of color. This establishes a clear opposition between the \"Karen\" figure and those being targeted by her behavior. Therefore, option B accurately reflects the social groups in opposition within the meme. The other options do not connect directly to the themes of the meme or the implications of the Karen archetype discussed in Document 1.",
    "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: B",
    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "To analyze the opposition in the meme, we refer to the relevant document which discusses the character \"Karen,\" a term used to represent an entitled woman often harassing people of color. According to Document 1, the term \"Karen\" has been associated with white women who have confronted or called the police on people of color, indicating a social conflict. The image caption describes a man talking on a cell phone, which suggests a potential interaction that might involve a \"Karen\" type figure. Thus, the most fitting opposition in this context is \"Karen vs. People of Color\" (Option B), as it aligns with the documented social conflicts surrounding the \"Karen\" meme. The other options do not reflect the specific social dynamics discussed in Document 1.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004.

    "reasoning": "In the provided document (specifically Document 3), \"Karen\" is characterized as a slang term for an irritating and entitled woman, often associated with social conflicts, especially in relation to race. This background is essential for understanding the humor and cultural commentary of the meme. Without this context, viewers may not grasp what \"Karen\" signifies, thus making option B the most relevant. The other options either incorrectly assume the humor or cultural significance remains intact without the context or misinterpret the meme's implications.

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** How does the meaning of the meme titled \"karen_2\" change when considering the image caption \"a man is talking on a cell phone\" in conjunction with the common perception of the term \"Karen\"?\n\nA) It suggests that the man is discussing a complaint about a \"Karen\" character.  \nB) It indicates the man is a \"Karen\" himself, showcasing entitlement.  \nC) The image distracts from the typical association of \"Karen\" with negative behavior.  \nD) It reflects a neutral scenario without any relation to the \"Karen\" stereotype.",
    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme, we first need to understand the context of the term \"Karen\" as detailed in Document 2. The document explains that \"Karen\" often represents an entitled or irritating woman, frequently associated with complaints and confrontations, particularly in racially charged situations. The image caption, \"a man is talking on a cell phone,\" doesn't inherently connect to the \"Karen\" stereotype, as it presents a neutral scenario of a man communicating. \n\nThus, option C, which states that the image distracts from the typical association of \"Karen\" with negative behavior, is the most accurate, as the image does not align with the negative connotations of the \"Karen\" meme. The other options speculate scenarios that do not align with the information provided in the documents.\n\nDocument 2 is crucial as it provides the necessary background on the \"Karen\" character's implications. The other documents are irrelevant distractors that do not contribute to understanding the meme's meaning. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme \"One does not simply ignore Karen memes\" suggests that Karen memes are widely recognized and have become a notable part of internet culture. This is supported by Document 1, which discusses the origins and spread of the \"Karen\" meme, emphasizing its prevalence in social commentary and humor. Therefore, the correct viewpoint presented in the meme aligns with option D, as it implies that the existence of Karen memes is too significant to overlook. The other options do not accurately reflect the sentiment expressed in the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

The image caption suggests a scenario where the man could be involved in a situation related to a \"Karen,\" especially in the context of complaints or disputes, which aligns with the known behaviors of the \"Karen\" stereotype. Options A and C resonate more with the typical narrative surrounding \"Karen\" interactions, where she is often depicted as a source of annoyance or conflict. However, option C is the most directly related, as it implies that the man could be discussing a complaint, which is a common theme in memes about \"Karen.\" Options B and D, while plausible, do not directly connect to the stereotypical interactions associated with \"Karen.\" Therefore, option C is the most aligned with the meme's implications.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme capitalizes on the established stereotype of \"Karen\" as an entitled character, which is thoroughly discussed in the oracle document (Document 0). The document mentions how \"Karen\" represents a broader cultural critique of certain behaviors, particularly those that involve entitlement and racial insensitivity. Thus, the meme suggests that ignoring these issues is not an option, aligning with option B, which emphasizes the serious implications of the portrayal of \"Karen\" in memes. The distractor documents (Documents 1, 2, and 3) do not provide relevant context to the meme's viewpoint.",

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme features a character associated with the \"Karen\" stereotype, which is characterized by entitlement and an expectation to speak to authority figures when faced with inconveniences. Document 1 provides context for the \"Karen\" meme, describing her as an entitled woman who often complains about trivial matters, such as coupons and customer service issues. The image humorously exaggerates this stereotype by linking it to the serious context of a pandemic, illustrating a perception that some people may react to crises with self-centered demands rather than understanding the broader situation. Options A, C, and D do not align with the specific portrayal of entitlement depicted in the meme. Therefore, the best answer is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

This document explains that \"Karen\" is often characterized as an irritating, entitled woman who is prone to causing social conflicts, particularly in situations involving race and authority. The other documents (0, 1, 2) are distractors and do not provide relevant context for understanding the meme or the stereotype it portrays.

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme features a character reminiscent of the \"Karen\" archetype, characterized by entitlement and a tendency to demand to speak to a manager, as indicated by the caption \"I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER OF THE CORONAVIRUS.\" This aligns directly with the description provided in Document 2, which outlines how \"Karen\" represents an irritating, entitled woman who often creates a scene over trivial matters. The other options do not reflect the essence of the \"Karen\" stereotype and its portrayal in popular culture. Hence, option B is the most accurate representation of the meme's social commentary.",

Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme features a character that embodies the \"Karen\" stereotype, known for her entitlement and complaints. The text suggests an exaggerated reaction to a serious situation (the pandemic), which aligns with the characterization of \"Karen\" as someone who demands to speak to a manager when things don't go her way. This context is supported by Document 3, which explains the \"Karen\" trope and its association with entitlement and absurdity in social interactions. The distractor documents (0, 1, 2) do not provide relevant insights regarding the meme's symbolism and message. Therefore, the best interpretation is that the meme critiques consumer entitlement during a crisis, making option A the correct choice.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The meme focuses on the character \"Karen,\" which is depicted as an entitled and often problematic woman in various social contexts, especially in situations involving conflict or privilege. The document that specifically discusses \"Karen\" (Document 3) explains how the term has evolved to symbolize a particular type of behavior associated with entitlement, particularly among white women. The other documents provided (0, 1, 2) are distractors that do not contribute relevant information regarding the \"Karen\" meme.

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004.

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What social message is delivered by the symbolic elements of this meme featuring a woman demanding to speak to the \"manager of the coronavirus\"?\n\nA) The meme criticizes the entitlement of certain individuals during crises.  \nB) The meme promotes the idea that crises are manageable through consumer complaints.  \nC) The meme implies that women are more likely to complain than men.  \nD) The meme suggests that public health issues can be resolved by appealing to authority.",
    "reasoning": "The meme references the \"Karen\" archetype, which is characterized as an entitled woman who often demands to speak to a manager in frustrating situations. Document 2 provides context on the term \"Karen,\" describing her as an antagonistic character that embodies entitlement and irritation, especially in situations involving perceived injustice. The caption about wanting to speak to the \"manager of the coronavirus\" highlights the absurdity of expecting a manager to resolve a global health crisis, thus illustrating the critique of entitlement during difficult times. This aligns with option A, making it the most relevant and accurate interpretation of the meme's message. The other options (B, C, D) do not accurately capture the essence of the meme as described in the documents.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004.

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously portrays the character \"Karen\" as someone who feels entitled to demand a manager even in a situation as serious as a pandemic. This aligns with the characterization of \"Karen\" discussed in Document 1, which describes her as an irritating, entitled figure who often seeks to exert control over others. The phrase \"I would like to speak to the manager of the coronavirus\" exemplifies the absurdity of trying to manage something that is inherently unmanageable, thus reflecting a satirical take on entitlement and the absurdity of certain social behaviors during crises. Options B, C, and D do not accurately capture the ironic humor presented in the meme. \n\nTherefore, option A is the most relevant as it encapsulates the social meaning behind the humor used in the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen.

He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen.

He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What does the use of the term \"Karen\" in the meme context, which features a woman holding a sign, signify about societal perceptions of certain behaviors?\n\nA) It refers to a woman advocating for social justice causes.  \nB) It represents a stereotype of entitled behavior often associated with white women.  \nC) It highlights women's rights movements throughout history.  \nD) It indicates a new trend in fashion among women.",
    "reasoning": "The meme context revolves around the term \"Karen,\" which is characterized as an irritating and entitled female character that has become a social stereotype. The relevant document (Document 3) provides a detailed explanation of the origins and meanings associated with \"Karen,\" linking it to behaviors of entitlement and privilege, particularly among white women. The other documents (0, 1, and 2) are distractors and do not provide any relevant information regarding the social meaning behind the humor used in this meme. Thus, option B is the correct answer as it accurately reflects the stereotype's societal implications.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen.

Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The meme utilizes the \"Karen\" caricature to illustrate the stereotype of an entitled individual who demands to speak to a manager over trivial matters, even in the face of a global crisis like the coronavirus. This aligns closely with the information from Document 2, which discusses the \"Karen\" stereotype as someone who exhibits irritating and entitled behavior. The humor lies in the exaggeration of expecting to speak to a \"manager\" about a virus, which is an absurd notion. The other options either misinterpret the meme's intent or stray from the established context of the \"Karen\" stereotype. Therefore, the best answer is A.",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme \"karen_1\" depicts a woman expressing her frustration about not being able to use a coupon for toilet paper during a crisis, followed by her demand to \"speak to the manager of the coronavirus.\" This illustrates a sense of entitlement and an expectation that there should be someone to address her complaints, even in an unprecedented situation like a pandemic. The relevant document is Document 0, which explains the character of \"Karen\" as an irritating and entitled figure often seen in memes. The other distractor documents do not provide relevant information to understand the social conflict depicted in the meme. Thus, the correct answer is B) The entitlement of individuals in public situations.",

    "reasoning": "The meme likely references the term \"Karen,\" which has become synonymous with a specific stereotype of entitled behavior, particularly among white women who display disruptive or demanding actions in public settings. This aligns with the information in Document 3, which explains the origin and usage of the \"Karen\" meme in depicting social conflict, particularly involving race and privilege. The other documents (0, 1, 2) are distractors and do not provide relevant information regarding the social conflict reflected in the meme. Therefore, option A is the most relevant, as it directly addresses the underlying societal tensions exemplified by the \"Karen\" character.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live.

After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout.

Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

The importance of social distancing in public health",
    "reasoning": "The meme reflects a humorous yet critical view of entitlement and the absurdity of demanding control over uncontrollable situations, represented by the phrase \"I would like to speak to the manager of the coronavirus.\" This aligns with the portrayal of the \"Karen\" character in Document 3, which discusses how \"Karen\" represents an entitled figure often in conflict over trivial issues. The other options, while relevant to broader social issues, don't capture the specific tension illustrated in the meme itself. Thus, the most fitting answer is B, as it highlights the humorous critique of expecting to manage a global health crisis.",

    "reasoning": "The meme exemplifies the stereotypical \"Karen\" character—an entitled, often unreasonable woman who demands to speak to a manager when faced with difficulties. The text in the meme highlights her frustration over trivial issues (like a coupon for toilet paper) juxtaposed with a serious situation involving pandemic response (healthcare workers in protective gear). This aligns with the description in Document 1 that discusses \"Karen\" as an irritating and entitled figure, further emphasizing her unreasonable demands even during a crisis. The other options do not capture the essence of the meme as effectively.",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme's context, document 1 provides a detailed explanation of the \"Karen\" character and how it is used in social conflict memes. It describes \"Karen\" as an irritating and entitled woman, often depicted in humorous scenarios that criticize her behavior. The image of a woman holding a sign in a black dress likely aligns with this stereotype, suggesting she may be embodying the characteristics associated with the \"Karen\" meme. The other documents (0, 2, 3) do not provide relevant information about the meme or the \"Karen\" stereotype. Therefore, option B is the most fitting answer.",
    "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: B",
    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme features a woman expressing frustration over a trivial matter (not being accepted a coupon) and then absurdly wanting to speak to the \"manager of the coronavirus.\" This aligns with the stereotypical portrayal of \"Karen\" as an entitled individual who overreacts in everyday situations, demanding to speak to a manager or authority figure. Document 1 provides context on the \"Karen\" meme, illustrating its usage as a portrayal of an irritating and entitled woman, reinforcing option B. The other options do not accurately capture the essence of the meme or the context provided in the documents. \n\nThus, the correct answer is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying.

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying.

    "reasoning": "The meme features a character resembling the stereotypical \"Karen,\" who is depicted as frustrated and entitled, wanting to \"speak to the manager\" of a serious issue (the coronavirus). This aligns well with the context provided in Document 0, which describes \"Karen\" as an irritating, entitled character often involved in trivial complaints or demands. The reference to her coupon for toilet paper during a crisis further emphasizes her misplaced priorities and entitlement.

    "reasoning": "The meme focuses on the character \"Karen,\" which is widely recognized as a representation of entitled behavior, particularly among certain demographics, often white women. This aligns closely with the characterization explained in Document 1, which details how the term \"Karen\" is used to describe an irritating, entitled woman who often behaves in ways that reflect privilege and entitlement. Document 1 provides insights into the origin and societal implications of the \"Karen\" meme, indicating that it critiques behaviors associated with privilege and entitlement rather than issues like gender equality, racial profiling, or environmental awareness. Therefore, the viewpoint presented by the meme is most likely addressing entitlement and privilege (Option C).",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What viewpoint does the meme titled \"karen_1\" present regarding the character of \"Karen\"?\n\nA) It portrays \"Karen\" as a victim of societal issues.  \nB) It mocks \"Karen\" for her entitlement and unrealistic demands.  \nC) It highlights the positive contributions of \"Karen\" in society.  \nD) It suggests that \"Karen\" is a misunderstood figure deserving sympathy.",
    "reasoning": "The meme features a woman with a stereotypical \"Karen\" appearance, expressing frustration over trivial issues while a serious situation unfolds in the background. This aligns with the descriptions in Document 0, which outlines how \"Karen\" is often characterized as entitled and irritating, specifically pointing out her unrealistic demands (e.g., wanting to speak to the manager). The humor stems from the contrast between her petty complaints and the serious context of the pandemic, reinforcing her stereotype. The distractor documents (1, 2, 3) do not provide relevant context or insight into the character of \"Karen.\" Therefore, option B is the most accurate representation of the meme's viewpoint.",

Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes.

    "reasoning": "The meme uses the term \"Karen,\" which is a contemporary slang term that emerged in the late 2010s and became widely recognized in the 2020s. Document 3 discusses the origins and cultural implications of the term \"Karen,\" linking it to modern societal issues and incidents that have occurred in recent years. The humor in questioning the existence of babies named Karen and their sudden appearance at age 40 aligns with the stereotype associated with middle-aged \"Karens\" who demand to \"speak to the manager.\" This context indicates that the meme reflects cultural attitudes from the 2020s rather than earlier decades.

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The context of the meme \"karen_3\" is likely influenced by the cultural understanding of the term \"Karen,\" which has evolved primarily in the last few years, especially during the 2010s. The term \"Karen\" has been widely used to describe a specific type of behavior associated with entitlement and privileged attitudes in contemporary society, particularly among white women, as discussed in the oracle document (Document 0). The mention of a man in a suit talking on a cell phone also suggests a modern professional setting, which aligns more closely with the 2010s culture where smartphones became ubiquitous in business and personal communication. Therefore, the most accurate answer would be D) The 2010s, as that era aligns with the rise of the \"Karen\" meme and the cultural contexts surrounding it.

    "reasoning": "The meme features the term \"Karen,\" which has become widely associated with a specific cultural stereotype that emerged prominently in the 2020s. The character of \"Karen\" is often depicted as an entitled individual who demands to speak to a manager, highlighting issues of privilege and social behavior in contemporary contexts. \n\nDocument 2 provides the most relevant context, detailing the origin and usage of the term \"Karen\" in memes, particularly noting its association with troubling behaviors observed in some individuals during this era. The mention of the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped, which gained traction in 2020, underscores the recent cultural relevance of the term. \n\nThe other documents (0, 1, and 3) are distractors and do not provide relevant information about the meme's cultural context. Thus, the correct answer is D) The 2020s, as this is when the stereotype became widely recognized and circulated in social media and popular culture.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What metaphorical meaning is conveyed through the expression in the meme titled \"karen_3\"?\n\nA) The term \"Karen\" is used to represent entitlement and demanding behavior in adults, suggesting that such traits are not present in younger generations.\n\nB) The meme suggests that individuals named Karen are inherently problematic and should not be trusted.\n\nC) The concept of the \"Karen\" character implies that once someone reaches a certain age, they automatically become entitled.\n\nD) The meme humorously questions the existence of babies named Karen, implying that the name is synonymous with a specific type of problematic adult behavior rather than representing an actual generational name.",
    "reasoning": "The meme directly references the stereotype of \"Karen\" as an entitled person who demands to speak to the manager, which is a common trope in contemporary discussions about social behavior. Document 3 provides a thorough explanation of the origins and implications of the term \"Karen,\" emphasizing the negative attributes associated with the name. The humor in the meme arises from the absurdity of questioning whether babies named Karen exist, highlighting the idea that the term has become detached from its literal meaning and is more a representation of adult behavior. Therefore, option D aligns best with the interpretation of the meme. Options A, B, and C do not capture the essence of the humor and metaphor as effectively.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "To decipher the metaphorical meaning of the meme, we need to consider the context provided in the oracle document (Document id=2) which discusses the \"Karen\" character. The \"Karen\" meme often highlights a sense of entitlement and frustration in social contexts, particularly among individuals perceived as privileged. \n\nOption A suggests authority and control, which is relevant but doesn’t directly connect to the \"Karen\" theme. Option B incorrectly implies that the man represents 'Karen,' who is typically characterized as a woman. Option D, while somewhat aligned with the notion of resolving conflicts, does not capture the essence of the \"Karen\" stereotype. \n\nOption C resonates with the \"Karen\" narrative as it implies that the man, despite being in a position of authority, may be out of touch with the grievances of others, reflecting the nature of many 'Karens' who fail to understand or acknowledge the issues faced by people outside their social sphere. Therefore, option C is the most fitting metaphorical interpretation in relation to the \"Karen\" meme.",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously questions whether individuals named \"Karen\" actually exist as babies or if they only emerge as entitled adults. This aligns with the established meaning of \"Karen\" as an entitled character in societal contexts, as explained in Document 2. Document 2 provides insight into the term \"Karen,\" describing it as a pejorative used to depict an annoying woman, often associated with entitlement. The humor in the meme underscores the stereotype that individuals named Karen only appear with certain negative traits, thus making option A (it suggests that \"Karen\" is a generational stereotype that doesn't apply to actual children) the most fitting interpretation. Options B and C, while related to entitlement, do not capture the essence of the generational joke as clearly as A. Option D is not supported by the context provided.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme discusses the stereotype associated with the name \"Karen,\" implying that women named Karen exhibit entitled behavior, particularly in situations where they demand to speak to a manager. This aligns with the information provided in Document 3, which explains the origins and social implications of the \"Karen\" meme. The other documents are distractors and do not provide relevant context for understanding the meme's content. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018.

Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme plays on the stereotype of \"Karen\" as an entitled figure, often demanding to speak to a manager. This directly relates to the characterization of \"Karen\" outlined in Document 2, which describes the term as representing an irritating, entitled woman who often engages in confrontational behavior, particularly in public situations. The humor in the meme arises from questioning whether \"Karens\" are born or if they simply emerge as entitled adults, reinforcing the stereotype. The other options either do not directly address the meme's content or relate less directly to the societal views on entitlement and the stereotype associated with the name \"Karen.\" Therefore, the best answer is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "To analyze this meme, we can refer to the oracle document (Document 0) that discusses the character \"Karen,\" who is often portrayed as an entitled individual causing social conflict, particularly in how she interacts with others, often demanding to speak to managers or taking offense in public situations. The image of a man in a suit talking on a cell phone suggests a figure of authority or corporate culture, which aligns with the ideological clash of entitlement versus social responsibility (option C). The character of \"Karen\" represents a critique of those who exhibit entitlement and disregard for others, a theme prevalent in the discussions around social conflicts mentioned in the document. The distractor documents (Documents 1, 2, and 3) do not provide any relevant information to deduce the ideological clash expressed in the meme. Therefore, the best choice is option C.",

    "reasoning": "The meme references the concept of \"Karen,\" a term used to describe entitled individuals, particularly women, who demand to speak to managers over trivial issues. This aligns closely with option B, as it directly addresses the conflict between customers who feel entitled and service workers who often have to deal with their unreasonable demands. Document 3 provides context about the term \"Karen\" and its usage in society, which further supports this interpretation.

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously questions whether babies named \"Karen\" exist or if they only emerge at a certain age to demand to speak to a manager, reflecting the stereotype associated with the name \"Karen.\" This aligns with the information in DOCUMENT 2, which describes \"Karen\" as an antagonistic character in memes known for being entitled and confrontational.

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "To analyze the question, we must consider the context provided in the oracle document (Document 1), which explains the concept of \"Karen\" as a slang term used to describe a specific type of entitled behavior, often associated with demanding to speak to managers or complaining about services. The image of a man in a suit talking on a cell phone likely suggests he is in a formal or business setting, which could imply he is discussing a customer service issue, a common theme in \"Karen\" memes. Option B directly relates to this interpretation, as it aligns with the behavior typically exhibited by \"Karens.\" Options A and C misinterpret the relationship or suggest unrelated meanings, while D dismisses any connection, which is inaccurate given the context. Therefore, the most plausible interpretation is that the man is addressing a situation that could typically invoke a \"Karen\" response, making B the correct choice.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously questions whether babies named \"Karen\" actually exist or if they only appear as entitled individuals around the age of 40, wanting to speak to a manager. This plays into the stereotype portrayed in the oracle document (Document 0) about \"Karen\" being an entitled character. The combination of the image of Dr. Evil, known for his comedic villainy, and the text creates a comedic effect highlighting this stereotype. Options A and C directly address the stereotype of \"Karen\" as an entitled person, with C being the most accurate reflection of the meme's humor. Options B and D do not align as closely with the core message of the meme. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What social issue is this meme criticizing?\n\nA) The trend of naming children after popular figures  \nB) The behavior of entitled individuals, often characterized as \"Karens\"  \nC) The concept of customer service in modern society  \nD) The ageism associated with certain names",
    "reasoning": "The meme humorously questions the existence of babies named \"Karen,\" implying that the name is predominantly associated with middle-aged women who exhibit entitled behavior, often seeking to speak to a manager in frustrating situations. This aligns closely with the description of \"Karen\" in Document 1, which discusses the term as a pejorative for irritating and entitled women, particularly in service contexts. The other options do not directly relate to the message conveyed in the meme. Therefore, the correct answer is B, as it addresses the behavior of entitled individuals.",
    "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: B",
    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme \"karen_3\" likely critiques the behaviors of individuals characterized as \"Karen,\" which is associated with entitlement and disruptive actions, particularly in social situations, as detailed in Document 0. The document explains the origins and implications of the term \"Karen,\" highlighting how it is used to describe irritating and entitled behaviors, often by white women in various contexts. The caption mentions a man in a suit talking on a cell phone, which does not directly relate to the issues presented by the Karen stereotype. Hence, option B is the most relevant answer. Options A, C, and D do not relate to the theme of the meme or the characterization of \"Karen.\"",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously questions the existence of babies named \"Karen,\" implying that women with this name only appear as entitled figures at a certain age, notably seeking to \"speak to the manager.\" This aligns closely with the characterization of \"Karen\" as an entitled woman who often escalates minor issues. Document 2 provides a detailed explanation of the \"Karen\" meme phenomenon, describing the character traits associated with it and how it has been used to critique behaviors perceived as entitled and irritating. The other documents do not relate to this social critique, making option A the most relevant choice.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme focuses on the character \"Karen,\" which has become a significant part of social commentary in the 2020s, often associated with entitlement and social media trends. Document 1 provides context regarding the \"Karen\" meme, including its emergence and cultural implications, particularly in the context of social media discussions and viral incidents. This aligns the meme with the 2020s, where such characterizations are prevalent. The distractor documents do not provide relevant information about the era reflected in the meme. Thus, the correct answer is D, representing contemporary social media culture.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The meme features the term \"Karen,\" which is used to describe a specific stereotype of entitled behavior, particularly associated with middle-aged white women. The cultural references in the meme, such as the phrase \"Even Karens are complaining about karens,\" highlight a contemporary social commentary that has gained traction in the last few years, particularly during the rise of social media and discussions around privilege and entitlement. The context provided in Document 2 elaborates on the origin and spread of the \"Karen\" meme, indicating its relevance to modern societal issues. The other documents (0, 1, 3) do not provide relevant information for understanding the cultural context of the meme, making Document 2 the primary oracle for answering the question. Given the meme's contemporary nature, it is likely to resonate most with Millennials or Generation Z, who are actively engaging with these cultural discussions online. Therefore, the best choice reflecting this era is C) Millennials.",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme draws on the cultural understanding of the term \"Karen,\" which is characterized as a woman who is often irritable and entitled, frequently complaining about others while not recognizing her own similar behavior. This aligns closely with the information in Document 3, which explains the origin and spread of the \"Karen\" meme phenomenon. The humor and irony in the meme underscore the hypocrisy of individuals who criticize others for doing something they themselves do, making option A the most relevant interpretation. The other options do not directly relate to the primary theme presented in the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "To answer this question, we can refer to Document 1, which discusses the characteristics and cultural significance of the term \"Karen.\" It indicates that \"Karen\" is often depicted as an irritating, entitled woman, which aligns with the stereotype represented in the meme. The image of a woman and a man could symbolize various social dynamics, but given the context of the \"Karen\" meme, option B is the most relevant. The other options (A, C, and D) do not capture the essence of what the \"Karen\" meme represents, making them less relevant. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme illustrates a situation where a woman, presumably a \"Karen,\" complains about others doing what she has just done herself—visiting a crowded beach. This reflects a common critique of hypocrisy, where individuals fail to recognize their own contradictions, particularly in the context of societal norms and behaviors. This aligns with the oracle document's discussion about \"Karen\" as a character who is often characterized by entitlement and a tendency to complain about others. The other options do not accurately capture the essence of the meme.

    "reasoning": "The meme illustrates a humorous contradiction where a woman, presumably a \"Karen,\" drives a long distance to the beach and then complains about the number of people there, which is ironic because she chose to go there herself. This aligns with the information in the oracle document about the \"Karen\" stereotype being characterized as someone who is entitled and often complains about situations they are part of. The other options do not accurately reflect the contradiction depicted in the meme. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it directly describes the situation in the meme. Options A, C, and D misinterpret the scenario presented.",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004.

[1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout.

He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme titled \"karen_4\" with the image caption of a woman and a man posing for a picture, we should refer to the context provided in Document 2, which discusses the character \"Karen\" as a pejorative term often associated with entitled behavior, particularly among certain demographics. This suggests that the meme may be playing on the irony of a \"Karen\" stereotype being associated with someone who appears happy or normal in a photo. \n\nIn this context, option C stands out as it implies that despite the negative implications of the \"Karen\" stereotype, the image shows a seemingly happy couple, which is a contradiction to what is typically expected from a \"Karen\" portrayal. The other options either do not directly address the stereotype or present scenarios that do not align with the essence of the meme. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What contradictory situation is being highlighted in the meme titled \"Even Karens are complaining about karens\"?\n\nA) A woman is enjoying her time at the beach while criticizing others for being there.\n\nB) A woman is upset about people who drive to the beach just to complain.\n\nC) A mother is shocked to find the beach crowded after driving a long distance.\n\nD) A woman is taking photos of other people while being critical of their presence.",
    "reasoning": "The meme illustrates a contradiction where the character traditionally identified as a \"Karen\" (an entitled or complaining person, particularly a white woman) is seen complaining about others who are also behaving in a similar manner. Document 0 provides context about the \"Karen\" meme and its characteristics, including the typical behaviors associated with the stereotype. The caption and image emphasize this irony, as it suggests that even those who embody the \"Karen\" stereotype are not immune to their own complaints. Options A, B, and D do not capture this irony as effectively as option C, which directly addresses the contradiction of being shocked by a crowded beach after making a long trip, highlighting the absurdity of the situation. Thus, option C is the most relevant and correct answer.",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004.

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What structural inequality is exposed by the meme titled \"Even Karens are complaining about Karens\"?\n\nA) Economic disparity among families  \nB) Racial discrimination in public spaces  \nC) Hypocrisy in privilege and entitlement  \nD) Gender inequality in social roles",
    "reasoning": "The meme highlights the irony of individuals characterized as \"Karens,\" who are often seen as entitled and privileged, complaining about similar behavior in others. This reflects a structural inequality in how entitlement is perceived and enacted, particularly among those who may not recognize their own privilege. Document 3 provides context about the \"Karen\" meme, illustrating the stereotype's roots in societal perceptions of entitlement, especially among certain demographics. The other documents (0, 1, 2) are distractors and do not contribute relevant information to understanding the meme's implications.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"karen_4\" likely references the cultural representation of \"Karen,\" a term often used to depict entitled behavior, particularly among white women in situations involving racial dynamics. Document 1 discusses the origins and characteristics of the \"Karen\" meme, focusing on its implications regarding social conflict, particularly in terms of race and entitlement. The mention of \"Karen\" in a negative light often highlights issues of racial profiling and the systemic inequalities faced by marginalized groups, which corresponds to option B. The other options, while related to social issues, do not specifically align with the context provided about \"Karen\" and her implications in social conflict as discussed in Document 1.

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme showcases a woman (labeled as a \"Karen\") expressing frustration about others at the beach, highlighting a common social critique regarding people who complain about situations they also participate in. This aligns with the concept of class privilege, as it reflects a sense of entitlement and inconsistency in behavior. The relevant document here is Document 3, which discusses the \"Karen\" phenomenon and its implications in social contexts, illustrating how certain individuals may feel entitled to criticize others while engaged in the same activities. Other documents (0, 1, 2) are distractions and do not contribute to understanding the meme's message about structural inequality.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The image and text together highlight a humorous take on the stereotype of \"Karens,\" particularly that they often complain about others while embodying the same behaviors. Document 1 explains the concept of \"Karen\" as an annoying, entitled character, which aligns with the meme's commentary. Therefore, option A is the most relevant, as it captures the essence of the meme by illustrating the hypocrisy of someone identified as a \"Karen.\" Options B, C, and D are less relevant as they do not directly address the relationship between the character and the text's message.",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme titled \"karen_4,\" we refer to Document 2, which details the concept of \"Karen\" as an antagonistic female character in memes, often characterized as entitled or irritating. The caption describes a woman and a man posing for a picture, which could imply a relationship where the woman might represent the \"Karen\" stereotype. None of the distractor documents provide relevant context for understanding the relationship depicted in the meme. Option A is the most aligned with the understanding of \"Karen\" as it suggests the woman embodies that stereotype, while options B, C, and D do not capture the essence of the \"Karen\" concept adequately.

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme's caption states, \"Even Karens are complaining about karens,\" which suggests a humorous take on the behavior associated with the \"Karen\" stereotype. This aligns with document 1, which details the characteristics and cultural significance of the term \"Karen,\" particularly in the context of complaining behavior. The image shows a woman, presumably a \"Karen,\" expressing dissatisfaction, reinforcing the humor in the statement that even those who embody the stereotype are still complaining. Options A and C are too specific and not supported by the general portrayal in the meme, while option D contradicts the theme of complaints central to the meme. Therefore, the best option is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously highlights the irony of individuals who engage in behaviors they subsequently criticize, thereby pointing out a common human hypocrisy. Document 1 provides background on the \"Karen\" stereotype, illustrating how it portrays a specific type of entitled behavior often criticized in social contexts. This context supports the notion that the meme critiques the duplicity of individuals who complain while participating in similar actions. The other options do not accurately reflect the critique presented in the meme. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What underlying assumptions or biases are suggested by the image caption \"a woman and a man are posing for a picture\" in the context of the \"Karen\" meme?\n\nA) The woman is likely to be perceived as the dominant figure in the relationship.  \nB) The man is expected to be the one taking the picture.  \nC) The woman may be viewed negatively due to her association with the term \"Karen.\"  \nD) The image suggests that both individuals are equally important in the photo.",
    "reasoning": "The relevant document here is Document 1, which explains the concept of \"Karen\" as a pejorative term for an entitled and often irritating woman, particularly in social contexts where she is depicted as confrontational or problematic. The caption implies a standard social interaction (posing for a picture) but does not inherently convey negative connotations. However, given the context of the \"Karen\" meme, it suggests that the woman may be viewed through the lens of the \"Karen\" stereotype, leading to assumptions of entitlement or annoyance. Therefore, option C is the most relevant, highlighting how the meme could carry biases against women labeled as \"Karen.\" The other options do not directly connect to the stereotype's implications. The distractor documents (0, 2, and 3) do not provide any relevant information about the meme's assumptions.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

Document 1 discusses the characterization of \"Karen\" as an irritating, entitled woman, which supports option B. The humor in the meme derives from the irony of someone fitting the \"Karen\" stereotype complaining about similar behavior from others, implying that such complaints are hypocritical. Options A and D do not capture the essence of the meme, while option C contradicts the overall tone. Therefore, the most accurate interpretation of the meme is that it highlights the hypocrisy of individuals identified as \"Karens.\"",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"
