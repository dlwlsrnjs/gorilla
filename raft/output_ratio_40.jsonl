    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"One does not simply ignore Karen memes\" references the \"Karen\" character, which is characterized as an irritating and entitled woman, commonly depicted in various memes. This aligns with the information provided in Document 1, which discusses the cultural significance of \"Karen\" as a pejorative term and outlines its origins and examples in popular culture. The other options (A, C, D) do not relate to the \"Karen\" phenomenon and are therefore irrelevant.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The image caption describes a man talking on a cell phone, which can be associated with the digital communication trend. However, the term \"Karen\" is prominent in the provided documents, especially Document 1, which outlines the characteristics and origins of the \"Karen\" meme phenomenon. This is relevant as the meme likely references the common portrayal of entitled individuals who create social conflict, particularly in public situations.

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme references the cultural phenomenon surrounding the term \"Karen,\" which is used to describe an entitled woman often involved in social conflicts, particularly in public settings. Document 3 provides insight into the \"Karen\" stereotype, detailing its origins and examples of its cultural significance. The image caption suggests an acknowledgment of the pervasive nature of \"Karen\" memes in popular culture. The other documents (0, 1, 2) are distractors and do not contribute relevant information regarding the meme's context. Therefore, the correct answer is B, as it directly aligns with the understanding of the Karen stereotype discussed in Document 3.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The meme features the phrase \"One does not simply ignore Karen memes,\" which suggests that Karen memes are pervasive and unavoidable in modern discourse. This aligns with the explanation in Document 1, which discusses the character \"Karen\" as an antagonistic figure often associated with entitlement and annoyance. The humor derived from the character's portrayal underscores the metaphorical message that one cannot escape the relevance of these memes in contemporary discussions, particularly about social behavior and entitlement. Thus, option A is the most appropriate interpretation. The other options do not capture the essence of the meme's message.",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What metaphorical meaning is conveyed through the expression in the meme titled \"karen_2,\" where a man is talking on a cell phone?\n\nA) The man is demonstrating authority and control in a situation.  \nB) The man is seeking help from a manager.  \nC) The man is expressing frustration typical of a \"Karen\" character.  \nD) The man is making a complaint about service.",
    "reasoning": "To analyze the metaphorical meaning conveyed in the meme, we need to reference the relevant document that discusses the \"Karen\" phenomenon. Document 3 provides insight into the character of \"Karen,\" describing her as an entitled and often frustrating figure, particularly in social conflicts. The act of a person talking on a cell phone in the context of a meme associated with \"Karen\" likely symbolizes a sense of entitlement or a desire to assert authority in a situation, which aligns with the negative connotations of the \"Karen\" stereotype. \n\nThe options A, B, and D suggest actions that might relate to authority or service complaints, but option C most directly relates to the frustration and entitlement associated with the character of \"Karen.\" Therefore, the metaphorical expression in the meme is best captured by option C. \n\nDistractor documents (0, 1, and 2) do not provide relevant information to help interpret the meme, as they are dummy documents unrelated to the \"Karen\" context. \n\nHence, the correct interpretation centers on the frustration typical of the \"Karen\" character, making option C the most appropriate choice.",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** In what way does the meme titled \"karen_2,\" featuring a man talking on a cell phone, incorporate satirical elements?\n\nA) It mocks the stereotype of men being less expressive than women.  \nB) It highlights the absurdity of a character often called \"Karen\" being involved in typical phone conversations.  \nC) It suggests that men are always on their phones and ignoring important issues.  \nD) It implies that phone conversations are irrelevant in the context of social conflict.",
    "reasoning": "The relevant document for understanding the satirical elements of the meme is Document 3, which elaborates on the character \"Karen\" and her stereotypical behaviors in social situations, particularly in conflicts. The meme presents a man on the phone, which can be interpreted as a humorous take on the stereotype that \"Karens\" often demand attention and create conflicts in social settings. Option B reflects this by acknowledging the absurdity of a \"Karen\" character being depicted in a mundane situation, which contrasts with her typical portrayal as someone who escalates issues. The other options either misinterpret the context or do not engage with the satire related to the \"Karen\" stereotype. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018.

Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme utilizes the phrase \"One does not simply ignore Karen memes\" to humorously highlight the pervasive nature of the \"Karen\" stereotype in contemporary culture. This aligns directly with Document 2, which discusses the characteristics and societal implications of the \"Karen\" archetype, particularly in terms of her irritable and entitled behavior. The humor arises from the exaggeration of how ubiquitous \"Karen\" memes have become, effectively making option B the correct choice. The other options either misunderstand the meme's intent or misrepresent the cultural critique it embodies.",

And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

[1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme and identify the social groups in opposition, I refer to Document 2, which defines \"Karen\" as a slang term for an entitled woman often depicted in memes as an antagonistic character. The meme itself, which states \"One does not simply ignore Karen memes,\" suggests a cultural commentary that implies a conflict between those who perpetuate and enjoy the \"Karen\" meme culture and those who might be the subjects of such memes, particularly individuals confronting the \"Karen\" character. \n\nThe other documents (1, 0, and 3) are distractors and do not provide relevant information about the social conflict represented in this meme. \n\nThus, the correct answer is option B, as it directly captures the opposition between the Karen character and those who are being confronted or judged by her actions in meme culture.",
    "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: B",
    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The relevant oracle document is Document 2, which explains the character \"Karen\" as representative of an antagonistic female figure, often portrayed in memes as irritating and entitled, particularly in situations involving interactions with people of color. The context of the meme, featuring a man talking on a cell phone, does not directly indicate opposition between men and women (A) or between parents and non-parents (C), nor does it suggest a conflict specifically between dog owners and non-dog owners (D). However, Document 2 highlights the historical and social tensions involving \"Karen\" figures and their interactions with people of color, making option B the most relevant. Therefore, the social groups in opposition in this meme are best captured by option B.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "Question: How does the meaning of the image caption \"a man is talking on a cell phone\" change when interpreted without the context of the term \"Karen\"?\n\nA) It emphasizes the man's annoyance at the conversation.  \nB) It suggests that the man is a typical “Karen” character.  \nC) It presents a neutral scenario unrelated to social conflict.  \nD) It implies that the man is trying to complain about a service.",
    "reasoning": "The image caption describes a neutral action, which does not inherently relate to the \"Karen\" character as defined in Document 1. The term \"Karen\" is used to depict an antagonistic character often involved in social conflicts, particularly concerning entitlement and racial issues. Without the context of \"Karen,\" the image simply depicts a man on a phone, which suggests a neutral scenario (Option C) rather than any conflict or entitlement associated with the \"Karen\" stereotype. Options A, B, and D suggest meanings that require the context of conflict or entitlement, which is absent in the caption alone. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** How does the meaning of the phrase \"One does not simply ignore Karen memes\" change when the text is viewed without the accompanying image of a man talking on a cell phone?\n\nA) The phrase becomes less humorous without the image.  \nB) The phrase loses its reference to the \"Karen\" meme culture.  \nC) The phrase implies that ignoring Karen memes is a common behavior.  \nD) The phrase suggests that Karen memes are universally accepted and appreciated.",
    "reasoning": "The relevant oracle document is Document 1, which explains the \"Karen\" meme and its cultural implications. The phrase in question directly references the understanding of \"Karen\" as an antagonistic character in memes, suggesting that ignoring such memes is unrealistic or foolish. Without the image, the humor and cultural context may diminish, making option B the most accurate regarding the change in meaning. Distractor documents do not provide relevant information to the meme's context.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

[1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme features a woman, presumably a \"Karen,\" expressing frustration over trivial matters in a serious context, suggesting an entitlement to complain about the situation (wanting to speak to the manager of \"the coronavirus\"). This aligns with the character traits discussed in Document 0, which portrays \"Karen\" as an irritating and entitled figure.

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What is the social meaning behind the humor used in the meme depicting a character demanding to speak to the \"manager of the coronavirus\"?\n\nA) It highlights the absurdity of entitlement during a public health crisis.  \nB) It promotes a serious discussion about customer service in healthcare.  \nC) It suggests that the coronavirus can be managed like a retail issue.  \nD) It reinforces negative stereotypes about women in crisis situations.",
    "reasoning": "The meme utilizes the \"Karen\" archetype, referencing the character's entitlement and demand for service in an inappropriate context. Document 2 provides a background on the \"Karen\" meme, explaining how it represents an irritating, entitled character, often in situations where such attitudes are absurd or unwarranted. This aligns with option A, as it emphasizes the absurdity of demanding a manager for a global health issue. Options B and C misinterpret the humor, and D focuses on gender stereotypes rather than the specific cultural critique. Thus, the correct interpretation is that the humor illustrates entitlement during a crisis, showcasing the ridiculousness of the character's demands.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme likely references the \"Karen\" stereotype, as explained in Document 1, which describes \"Karen\" as an irritating, entitled woman often depicted in various social conflicts. This aligns with option B, as the meme's humor likely stems from a situation where a \"Karen\" is expressing her entitlement or demanding to speak to a manager, which is a common trope associated with such characters. Options A, C, and D do not accurately capture the essence of the \"Karen\" stereotype or its societal implications as discussed in the oracle document. Thus, option B is the most relevant and accurate interpretation of the meme's social commentary.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The humor in this meme stems from the juxtaposition of a trivial complaint about toilet paper coupons with the serious context of a health crisis, represented by the people in protective gear. This aligns well with option B, as it highlights the absurdity of prioritizing minor inconveniences over significant issues like a pandemic. The distractor documents do not provide relevant context or insights into the social meaning behind the meme. The humor relies on the exaggerated reaction of the woman, typically referred to as a \"Karen,\" which fits the critique of demanding authority in trivial matters.

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

[1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout.

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"karen_1\" likely references the \"Karen\" meme phenomenon, which is characterized by themes of entitlement, privilege, and often a confrontational attitude, particularly in situations involving racial dynamics. The relevant document for this analysis is Document 2, which provides a comprehensive overview of the \"Karen\" character's traits and the social implications of her actions, particularly in contexts where she is depicted as harassing people of color or demanding to speak to management. This aligns closely with option B, which addresses the conflict arising from entitlement and privilege, reflecting the meme's commentary on social dynamics associated with the \"Karen\" stereotype. Options A, C, and D do not directly relate to the specific social conflict illustrated by the \"Karen\" meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What social conflict or tension is reflected in the meme titled \"karen_1\"?\n\nA) The frustration of consumers during the pandemic.  \nB) The ineffectiveness of government responses to the pandemic.  \nC) The entitlement of individuals in crisis situations.  \nD) The role of humor in coping with societal issues.",
    "reasoning": "The meme utilizes the character \"Karen\" to illustrate a sense of entitlement and frustration, particularly in a crisis context, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This relates closely to the characterization of \"Karen\" as an irritating, entitled woman who often demands to speak with a manager, reflecting an attitude of privilege and dissatisfaction (as noted in Document 0). The caption about the coupon for toilet paper suggests a trivial concern during a serious crisis, emphasizing the absurdity of her entitlement. Thus, option C is the most relevant choice as it directly addresses the \"Karen\" stereotype's portrayal in social conflicts. The other options, while related to societal tensions, do not specifically address the entitlement aspect that is central to this meme. Documents 0 provides essential context for understanding the \"Karen\" meme, while the distractor documents (1, 2, 3) do not contribute to this analysis.",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life.

    "reasoning": "The meme combines a visual representation of a stereotypical \"Karen\" character—who is known for being entitled and complaining—along with text that expresses frustration over a lack of toilet paper during a pandemic, suggesting a humorous take on her exaggerated response. Document 3 provides context about the \"Karen\" meme phenomenon, illustrating how the character embodies complaints and entitlement in various scenarios, including public health issues. Option C captures the essence of the frustration expressed in both the image and the text, making it the most suitable answer. Other options either misinterpret the relationship or focus on irrelevant points.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme features a woman, typically characterized as a \"Karen,\" who is upset about not being able to use a coupon for toilet paper, which is a humorous exaggeration during a time of crisis. The background shows individuals in protective gear, indicating a serious situation (likely related to the pandemic). This aligns with the document text that describes the character \"Karen\" as someone who often demands to speak to a manager, indicating entitlement and a lack of awareness of the broader context. Therefore, option A is correct as it captures the essence of the meme, while the other options misinterpret the woman's demeanor and the context of the situation. The relevant document is Document 2, which explains the \"Karen\" character and her typical behavior. The distractor documents do not provide any pertinent information for this analysis.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously depicts a person expressing frustration over a trivial issue (a coupon for toilet paper) in the context of a much larger crisis (the coronavirus pandemic). This suggests a viewpoint that individuals might blame external factors (like the \"manager of the coronavirus\") instead of addressing the situation realistically. While the provided documents are all distractors with no relevant content, the humor and frustration expressed in the meme align with option B.

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"karen_1\" features a woman holding a sign, which suggests a public sentiment or protest. Given the context provided in Document 0, where \"Karen\" is described as a representation of an entitled woman, often depicted in social conflicts, it can be inferred that the meme addresses the behavior of certain individuals in public spaces, particularly those who exhibit entitlement or a lack of awareness in their interactions with others. This aligns with option B. The other options (A, C, D) do not directly relate to the established characteristics of the \"Karen\" meme, making them less relevant. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What viewpoint does the meme \"karen_1\" present regarding entitlement and the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nA) It portrays a humorous take on people's frustrations during the pandemic.  \nB) It criticizes individuals who are overly demanding in crisis situations.  \nC) It emphasizes the importance of following health guidelines.  \nD) It suggests that crises bring out the best in people.",
    "reasoning": "The meme uses the character \"Karen\" to illustrate a sense of entitlement and frustration, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The caption suggests that the character feels wronged by not being able to use a coupon for toilet paper and now has a ridiculous demand to \"speak to the manager of the coronavirus,\" which reflects a humorous critique of how some individuals respond to crises with entitlement. This aligns with the portrayal of \"Karen\" as an irritating and entitled figure discussed in Document 0, making option B the best answer. Options A, C, and D do not capture the specific critique of entitlement depicted in the meme.",
    "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: B",
    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004.

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004.

    "reasoning": "The meme references the cultural phenomenon associated with the term \"Karen,\" which is linked to the behavior of certain entitled individuals, typically portrayed as middle-aged white women. This characterization has gained significant traction in social media and pop culture, particularly during the late 2010s and early 2020s, aligning with millennial and Gen Z discussions about social issues and privilege. Document 2 provides a comprehensive overview of the \"Karen\" meme, explaining its emergence and the cultural context surrounding it. The humor in the meme suggests a satirical take on the stereotype, indicative of contemporary culture rather than older generations, which further points towards the millennial and Gen Z era. The distractor documents do not contain relevant contextual information about the meme. Therefore, the correct answer is C) Millennials.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme title \"karen_3\" suggests a reference to the \"Karen\" meme phenomenon, which critiques individuals (usually women) perceived as entitled or demanding beyond the bounds of what is considered appropriate. The image caption describes a man in a suit on a cell phone, which is characteristic of corporate culture and modern communication practices associated with Millennials and Generation Z. However, the use of cell phones for business communication is also prevalent among Generation X, who were the first to adopt this technology. The documents provided do not offer specific insights into cultural contexts related to the meme, as they are all distractor documents. Thus, I will rely on general cultural knowledge that associates the \"Karen\" meme with a critique of behaviors often linked to Millennials and Generation Z. Given that the meme is modern and involves contemporary communication methods, the most relevant options would be C) Millennials and D) Generation Z. However, the culture encapsulated by the meme leans more towards the ironic critique of Millennials. Therefore, the best answer would be C) Millennials.",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What metaphorical meaning is conveyed through the expression in the meme titled \"karen_3\"?\n\nA) It suggests that the name \"Karen\" is associated with entitlement and demands for authority.  \nB) It implies that people named Karen are universally disliked.  \nC) It indicates that the concept of a \"Karen\" is a recent phenomenon, with no historical presence.  \nD) It conveys that the behavior of a \"Karen\" is a stereotype that transcends age and is recognized culturally.",
    "reasoning": "The meme humorously questions whether babies named \"Karen\" exist or if they only appear as entitled individuals at age 40. This aligns closely with the characterization of \"Karen\" in Document 1, which explains the term as a pejorative for entitled behavior, especially in middle-aged women. The phrase \"want to speak to the manager\" is a common stereotype associated with \"Karens,\" emphasizing entitlement and demands for authority. Therefore, option A accurately captures the metaphorical meaning conveyed in the meme.\n\nOptions B and C are misinterpretations; while some may dislike the stereotype, it isn't universally applicable, and the concept of \"Karen\" as a negative stereotype has been established, suggesting historical presence. Option D, while it touches on cultural recognition, does not directly address the specific metaphorical meaning reflected in the meme's questioning of the name's existence.\n\nThus, the best answer is A.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What metaphorical meaning is conveyed through the expression in the meme featuring a man in a suit talking on a cell phone?\n\nA) The man is demonstrating authority and professionalism.  \nB) The man is representing a typical \"Karen\" scenario where someone is demanding attention.  \nC) The man is expressing frustration with a \"Karen\" character.  \nD) The man is indicative of modern communication and its impact on social interactions.",
    "reasoning": "To analyze the metaphorical meaning in the meme with the man in a suit on a phone, we need to reference the content from Document 2, which discusses the concept of a \"Karen\" and how she embodies entitlement and demanding behavior in various social situations. Although the image depicts a man, the context of how \"Karen\" is perceived might imply that he could be engaging with a \"Karen\" or is in a situation where such characters are involved. However, other options such as A and D also seem plausible as they relate to professional and modern communication themes. Given the lack of a direct reference to a \"Karen\" in the image, the most relevant interpretations are still those that connect back to the professional demeanor illustrated by the man in the suit. Thus, option A, which suggests authority and professionalism, resonates best given the context. Options B and C suggest a direct interaction with the \"Karen\" concept but do not directly relate to the image’s expression. Therefore, A is the most fitting answer here.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What metaphorical meaning is conveyed through the expression in the meme featuring the character Dr. Evil?\n\nA) The existence of individuals who are overly demanding and confrontational  \nB) The idea that certain names carry specific societal stereotypes  \nC) The notion that people become entitled as they age  \nD) The belief that every generation has its own unique challenges",
    "reasoning": "The meme humorously questions whether babies named \"Karen\" exist or if they instantly become entitled adults wanting to \"speak to the manager\" at age 40. This aligns with the characterization of \"Karen\" as an entitled woman, which is discussed in Document 2. The other documents provided are distractors and do not pertain to the metaphorical meaning of the meme. The correct answer is B, as it captures the societal stereotype associated with the name \"Karen.\"",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times.

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What social phenomenon is being mocked through the expression in this meme titled \"karen_3,\" featuring a man in a suit talking on a cell phone?\n\nA) The rise of corporate culture  \nB) The stereotype of entitled individuals  \nC) The challenges of remote work  \nD) The popularity of smartphone usage",
    "reasoning": "The meme seems to reference the \"Karen\" stereotype, which is characterized by entitled behavior, often associated with individuals who demand to speak to authority figures (such as managers) when things do not go their way. Document 3 provides a comprehensive background on the term \"Karen,\" including its use to describe an irritating, entitled woman, fitting the context of the meme. The other documents (0, 1, 2) are distractors and do not provide relevant information regarding the stereotype that the meme is likely mocking. Therefore, option B, \"The stereotype of entitled individuals,\" aligns best with the context of the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously questions whether babies named \"Karen\" truly exist or if the name is only associated with middle-aged women who exhibit entitled behavior, often depicted as wanting to \"speak to the manager.\" This reflects a broader societal frustration with entitlement and privilege, particularly in the context of racial and social dynamics, which is supported by the context documents, particularly Document 0. The other options either don't align directly with the meme's content or are not supported by the documents.

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What ideological clash within society is expressed through the meme titled \"karen_3,\" featuring a man in a suit talking on a cell phone?\n\nA) The struggle between professional authority and social entitlement.  \nB) The conflict between urban and rural lifestyles.  \nC) The tension between individual rights and community standards.  \nD) The divide between technological advancement and traditional values.",
    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"karen_3\" likely invokes themes surrounding the \"Karen\" archetype, which represents entitled behavior often associated with white women, particularly in societal conflicts involving race and authority (as discussed in Document 0). The image of a man in a suit talking on a cell phone may symbolize professional authority, contrasting with the entitlement seen in \"Karen\" behavior. This implies a clash between the professional demeanor expected in certain contexts and the disruptive behavior often attributed to the \"Karen\" stereotype. Thus, option A is the most relevant and accurately reflects the ideological clash represented. Options B, C, and D are less directly related to the context provided in the documents.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What ideological clash within society is expressed through this meme featuring a character asking about \"Karens\"?\n\nA) The generational divide in naming conventions  \nB) The stereotype of entitled behavior associated with the name \"Karen\"  \nC) The importance of customer service in modern society  \nD) The role of humor in addressing social issues",
    "reasoning": "The meme directly references the stereotype of women named \"Karen\" as entitled individuals who demand to speak to managers, reflecting societal frustrations with such behavior. This connects to Document 3, which discusses the origins and societal implications of the \"Karen\" stereotype. The other documents do not provide relevant context for this specific ideological clash, making them distractors. Therefore, option B is the most accurate representation of the clash depicted in the meme.",
    "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: B",
    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously questions whether babies named Karen exist or if they only appear at age 40, which aligns with option C. This reflects a social commentary on the stereotype associated with adults named Karen who often demand to speak to a manager. The other options (A, B, and D) do not accurately reflect the message conveyed by the meme. None of the provided documents (0, 1, 2, 3) offer relevant context for the meme's humor, as they are all distractor documents and do not relate to the discussion of the name Karen.

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What is the implied social commentary of the meme titled \"karen_3,\" which features a man in a suit talking on a cell phone?\n\nA) People in suits are often distracted and out of touch.  \nB) Cell phones are a sign of social status.  \nC) The conversation is more important than the appearance.  \nD) Businessmen are always working, even in casual settings.",
    "reasoning": "The context of the meme titled \"karen_3\" suggests a potential commentary on social interactions, particularly the stereotype associated with \"Karen\" figures who are often portrayed as demanding or entitled, often in professional settings. The image of a man in a suit talking on a cell phone may imply that he is preoccupied with business, possibly at the expense of social interactions, aligning with option A. The distractor documents provided do not offer relevant insights into the meme's interpretation as they are all dummy documents without substantive content. Therefore, the most fitting commentary regarding the image and its socially charged context is option A, as it encapsulates the idea of being distracted and out of touch in a professional environment.",

Document 2 provides a detailed explanation of the \"Karen\" meme phenomenon, especially highlighting instances where this character was involved in racial harassment. The example of Amy Cooper, known as \"Central Park Karen,\" illustrates the issue of racial profiling and privilege, making option B the most relevant choice here.

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme uses humor to highlight the stereotype of women named \"Karen\" as entitled and demanding, particularly in situations where they want to \"speak to the manager.\" This aligns with the concept of \"Karen\" as a pejorative term for a certain type of behavior, which is discussed in document 2. The other options do not directly relate to the meme's content or the established stereotype. Documents 0, 1, and 3 do not provide relevant context to the meme's criticism. Thus, the correct answer is C.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen.

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen.

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

    "reasoning": "To analyze the culture reflected in the meme titled \"karen_4,\" we can draw from the relevant document (Document 0) that discusses the term \"Karen.\" This document highlights how \"Karen\" has come to symbolize a specific stereotype of entitled behavior, commonly associated with middle-aged white women, particularly in the context of social conflicts and racial issues that gained prominence in the late 2010s and early 2020s. The meme's context implies a contemporary understanding of social dynamics, which aligns with cultural discussions prevalent in the Millennials and Generation Z. \n\nGiven that the meme uses the \"Karen\" trope, which has been widely circulated and discussed in the context of modern social media culture, it indicates a more recent generational influence rather than older ones like the Baby Boomers or Generation X. Thus, the cultures of the Millennial Generation and Generation Z are both significant, but the heightened visibility and discussions around \"Karen\" have been particularly tied to events and social media trends of the late 2010s, which suggest a stronger link to Generation Z.\n\nThus, the best answer reflecting the culture in the meme is likely D) Generation Z, as they are more involved with the meme's social implications and the digital landscape in which it thrives.",

    "reasoning": "The relevant document that helps to interpret this meme is Document 3, which discusses the character \"Karen\" as an antagonistic figure often characterized by entitlement and annoyance, frequently depicted in memes. Given the context of the meme with the title \"karen_4\" and the image caption of a woman and a man posing, it is reasonable to infer that the woman symbolizes a \"Karen\" figure, reflecting the stereotype of entitled behavior. The other documents provided (0, 1, 2) are distractors and do not contribute to understanding the symbolism in this context. Therefore, option A is the best choice as it directly correlates with the established characterization of \"Karen.\"",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

    "reasoning": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the context provided by the image caption, which mentions a woman and a man posing for a picture. The question asks for a contradictory situation highlighted in the meme. Options A, B, C, and D present various scenarios that could indicate contradiction or irony. \n\nSince the document texts provided are all distractors and do not provide relevant information about the meme's context, we rely solely on the image caption. The options A, B, C, and D each describe a potential contradiction in the scenario of posing for a picture. \n\nConsidering the context, option B (\"The woman appears to be upset while the man is smiling\") represents a clear contradiction in emotional expression during a moment that is typically joyous like taking a picture together. This juxtaposition of emotions can be seen as a source of irony, aligning with the theme of the meme.\n\nThus, the correct answer highlighting this contradiction is B.",

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The meme features a character identified as a \"Karen,\" which is a term used to describe an entitled and often annoying individual, particularly in contexts of complaining about others, as explained in Document 2. The text implies that even those who fit the \"Karen\" stereotype can exhibit the same behavior they criticize, highlighting hypocrisy. This aligns with the behavior described in the meme, where the character complains about others while also engaging in similar behavior. Therefore, option B is the most accurate interpretation of the meme's message. The other options do not align with the context provided in Document 2 about the \"Karen\" stereotype. \n\nRelevant Document: Document 2 is the oracle document that explains the \"Karen\" stereotype and its implications. \nDistractor Documents: Documents 0, 1, and 3 do not provide relevant information regarding the meme's context.",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The image caption describes a basic scenario of a woman and a man posing together, which does not provide much context about the 'Karen' stereotype directly. However, given the title \"karen_4\" and the understanding from the oracle document, which explains the 'Karen' stereotype as an annoying, entitled woman often involved in humorous or negative situations, option B is most relevant. It suggests that even if the image seems neutral, it could still be framed humorously within the 'Karen' meme context. The other options either misinterpret the relationship or do not connect to the 'Karen' theme. Therefore, B is the most suitable answer based on the meme's context.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What is the relationship between the text and the image in this meme?\n\nA) The meme shows a woman complaining about others, highlighting the irony of a \"Karen\" criticizing similar behavior.  \nB) The image depicts a man and a woman at the beach, which has no relevance to the term \"Karen.\"  \nC) The caption refers to a specific incident unrelated to the concept of a \"Karen.\"  \nD) The meme is a straightforward depiction of a beach outing with no commentary on social behaviors.",
    "reasoning": "The text of the meme references the stereotype of \"Karens\" as individuals who complain about others while engaging in the same behavior, which is illustrated in the image where a woman appears to be expressing frustration about others at the beach. Document 2 provides context about the \"Karen\" stereotype, detailing its characteristics and the irony often associated with such behavior. This makes option A the most relevant answer, as it aligns with the theme of the meme. The other options either misinterpret the context or fail to connect with the stereotype discussed in the oracle document.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What underlying assumptions or biases might the meme \"Even Karens are complaining about Karens\" convey regarding the behavior of individuals labeled as \"Karens\"?\n\nA) It suggests that people labeled as \"Karens\" are self-aware and recognize their own behavior.  \nB) It implies that all individuals named Karen exhibit the same negative behavior and attitudes.  \nC) It indicates that the term \"Karen\" is used to unfairly stereotype women, regardless of their actual behavior.  \nD) It portrays a humorous contradiction where even those who fit a stereotype can criticize their own actions.",
    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme, we can reference Document 2, which discusses the cultural context and characteristics associated with the \"Karen\" stereotype. This document outlines how \"Karen\" is used as a pejorative to describe entitled behavior, particularly among certain demographics. The meme plays on the contradiction of someone identified as a \"Karen\" also complaining about others similarly behaving, which aligns with option D's portrayal of humor in self-criticism. \n\nOptions A and B imply self-awareness and a universal behavior pattern among those labeled as \"Karens,\" but the meme does not explicitly support these claims. Option C introduces the idea of unfair stereotyping, which is relevant but not the primary focus of the meme's humor. Thus, option D best captures the essence of the meme's commentary on the contradiction in behavior. \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation of the meme aligns with option D.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen.

He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What underlying message might the meme titled \"karen_4,\" which depicts a woman and a man posing for a picture, convey about gender and entitlement?\n\nA) It promotes equality between genders and dismisses stereotypes.  \nB) It suggests that women are often viewed as entitled or irritating when they assert themselves.  \nC) It highlights the positive aspects of social media relationships.  \nD) It implies that all women should be encouraged to express their opinions freely.",
    "reasoning": "The relevant document here is Document 3, which explains the cultural significance of the term \"Karen\" as a pejorative associated with entitled behavior, particularly in the context of women. The image caption does not provide explicit context, but the title and the common understanding of a \"Karen\" might suggest that the meme is playing on the stereotype of women who assert themselves in social situations, leading to perceptions of entitlement or irritation. This aligns with option B. The other options do not directly relate to the established connotations of the \"Karen\" stereotype or the implications of the image.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",
