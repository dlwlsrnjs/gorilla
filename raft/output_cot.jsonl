    "reasoning": "The meme plays on the stereotype that women named Karen are entitled and demanding, typically wanting to \"speak to the manager.\" By humorously suggesting that \"Karens\" only appear at age 40, it exaggerates the stereotype and emphasizes the absurdity of the character's behavior, thereby reinforcing the cultural commentary surrounding the term.
