Several websites covered her use of the hashtag including Buzzfeed[7] and The Independent.\n\nWhen Women Refuse\nOn May 26th, 2014, the Tumblr blog WhenWomenRefuse[17], which collects examples of violence against women at the hands of men they romantically rejected, was created.

They are learning that when they say campus victimizations are ubiquitous (“micro-aggressions,” often not discernible to the untutored eye, are everywhere), and that when they make victimhood a coveted status that confers privileges, victims proliferate.\"\n\nOn the following day, Will’s column was immediately met with heavy backlash from victims of campus sexual assaults on Twitter, which generated up to 20,000 mentions of the hashtag #SurvivorPrivilege within the first week and ultimately prompted The St. Louis Post-Dispatch to drop his column in the wake of the controversy.\n\n#NotJustHello\nOn June 20th, 2014, Twitter user Mikki Kendall posted a tweet calling for people to refrain from trying to justify street harassment as a form of courtship, to which @Feminist_Inti chimed in with a toungue-in-cheek response (shown below).\nThen on June 22nd, Twitter user @UJohnsmeyer replied to both users asking if they had ever considered that some men might just be striking up conversations with women they find attractive.\nThe tweet was subsequently criticized by several people following the conversation for misunderstanding the meaning of harassment, leading Kendall to post the hashtag #NotJustHello to emphasize that harassing behaviors should not be confused with polite greetings.[31]Many Twitter users subsequently began posting examples of street harassment and theories about motivating factors behind the behavior accompanied by the hashtag.[32][33] Later that day, The Daily Dot[29] published an article highlighting several notable #NotJustHello tweets (shown below)."
