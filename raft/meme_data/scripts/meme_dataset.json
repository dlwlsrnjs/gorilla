    "doc_text": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen.

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"
