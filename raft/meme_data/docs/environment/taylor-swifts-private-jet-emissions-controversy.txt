About
Taylor Swift's Private Jet Emissions ControversyÂ refers to aÂ controversyÂ andÂ leakÂ of information thatÂ AmericanÂ singer-songwriterÂ Taylor SwiftÂ allegedly produces more carbon emissions than any other celebrity in 2022, amassing to roughly 8,200 tonnes. This is due to unnecessary plane rides that Swift allegedly takes in her private jet. After the information surfaced in an op-ed article and then onÂ Twitter, Swift was labeled as a hypocrite given her "climate change awareness" public persona. The discovery led toÂ memes, similar in nature to memeticÂ discourseÂ regardingÂ Kyle Jenner's Three-Minute Flights. It was also met with skepticism by people who thought the data was unfounded. In 2024, Taylor Swift's attorneys threatened legal action against Jack Sweeney, the admin of the flight tracker account Celeb Jets, who'd been previously banned onÂ Twitter / XÂ for hisÂ ElonJetÂ account.
History
On July 25th, 2022, news outlet The Tab[1]Â published an article titled, "The celebs who have racked up the most CO2 emissions this year using their private jets," most likely inspired by prior discussion regardingÂ Kylie Jenner's private jet controversy. The Tab's list ranked the top 10 celebrity "climate criminals" and their overall carbon emissions in tonnes over the course of 2022 thus far:
Reactions
On July 29th, 2022,Â Twitter[2]Â user yslonika tweeted two screenshots from The Tab's article, displaying Swift as the number one climate offender on the list. The tweet received roughly 45,600 likes in three days (shown below, left). Twitter user yslonika started a thread underneath their tweet with the first reply[3]Â attaching another screenshot of Swift's section with more information. The reply received roughly 12,200 likes in the same amount of time (shown below, right).

Later on July 29th, Twitter[4]Â user BesDMarx also tweeted screenshots of The Tab's article, captioning them, "taylor swift has emitted more co2 this year than an average US american does within 550 years and more than a person from india in over 4,300 years," and earning roughly 190,000 likes in three days (shown below, left). On July 29th, verified Twitter[5]Â user kylietcheungÂ quote retweetedÂ BesDMarx, attaching a screenshot of an article related to Swift becoming one of the "world's biggest sustainable fashion influencers." The QT received roughly 1,600 likes in three days (shown below, right).
Fans of Swift and other skeptics tried poking holes in The Tab's article. For instance, on July 29th, Twitter[6]Â user nickputation tweeted screenshots showing evidence that The Tab's evidence was unfounded, claiming that Swift's actual carbon emissions were a third of what was represented. Their tweet received over 6,000 likes in three days (shown below, left). Later on July 29th, Twitter user 1989tvalbum (since-deleted) started a thread that they called, "Taylor Swift and her care for the environment," aiming to prove the people of Twitter wrong. In one day, the thread's primary tweet (since-deleted) received roughly 2,100 likes (shown below, right).
Twitter user 1989tvalbum deleted their account soon after their thread went viral primarily due to the backlash they received for it. Many found it tone deaf, causing them to screenshot it and make funny tweets about it. For instance, on July 30th, 2022, Twitter[7]Â user BesDMarx posted two screenshots from 1989tvalbum's thread (shown below), captioning them, "this thread is for the Twitter hall of fame," and earning roughly 134,200 likes in two days.


Developments
Taylor Swift's Response To The Allegations
A spokesperson for Taylor Swift was interviewed by The Rolling Stone[8]Â on July 29th, 2022 for their article on the matter. The spokesperson was quoted saying, "Taylorâ€™s jet is loaned out regularly to other individualsâ€¦ To attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect."

The Washington Post[13]Â further reported that Swift's legal team was addressing, "direct and irreparable harm, as well as emotional and physical distress" to Swift and her family.
