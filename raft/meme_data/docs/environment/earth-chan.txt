About
Earth-chan is an anime-style anthropomorphic representation of the planet Earth. She is depicted as a young girl with hair dyed in the colors blue and green, resembling a photograph of the planet taken from space. Online, image macros featuring the character often contain jokes using the popular anime trope of characters being insecure about their flat chest by referencing to the flat earth theory.

Origin
On November 30th, 2017, Twitter user @Trinimmortal tweeted a joke about creating an anime featuring the planets of our solar system as anime girls, which would contain a running gag about Earth-chan saying "I'm not flat!" On December 4th, Twitter user @felipecunhaeloi[2] responded to the tweet with an illustration of the anime idea (shown below).

Spread
On December 7th, DeviantArtist DatWeirdoWhoLuvsMilk posted several illustration of Earth-chan wearing a surgical mask (shown below).[4]
