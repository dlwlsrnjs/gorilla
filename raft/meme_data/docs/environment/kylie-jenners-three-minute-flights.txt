Overview
Kylie Jenner's Three-Minute Flights refers to a controversy involving Kylie Jenner and evidence of her taking unnecessarily short flights with her private jet. After screenshots of her flight paths were posted by the Twitter account @CelebJets, users labeled her a "climate criminal" in regards to climate change. The flights were purportedly as short as three minutes long while most were roughly 12 minutes long, being only 45 minutes by car.

Background
On July 12th, 2022, the Twitter[1] account CelebJets (an automated bot that tracks the flights of celebrities' private jets) posted two tweets that documented a flight taken by Kylie Jenner from Camarillo, California to Van Nuys, California. The first tweet[2] earned over 460 likes in one week and revealed that the flight would take an estimated three minutes of flight time (shown below, left). The second tweet[3] revealed that the flight ended up taking 17 minutes, earning 22 likes in the same amount of time (shown below, right).
On July 15th, 2022, the Twitter[4] account CelebJets tracked another flight from Kylie Jenner arriving in Camarillo, California, that took an estimated 12 minutes in flight time. The tweet received over 480 likes in four days (shown below, left). The next day, July 16th, Jenner posted on Instagram [5] a photo of her and Travis Scott in front of their own private jets with the caption, "you wanna take mine or yours ?" The post received roughly 8.1 million likes in three days (shown below, right).

On July 16th, Twitter[6] user NiicePeaches praised Jenner in a tweet that attached a screenshot of Jenner's Instagram post and captioned it, "For me? Hardest post this year." It earned roughly 61,300 likes in three days (shown below, left). This inspired Twitter[7] user emily_murnane to tweet a rebuttal, attaching a screenshot of CelebJets' tweet[2] about Jenner's three-minute flight. Emily_murnane captioned it, "Just remembered how Kylie Jenner uses her private jet to make 3 minute flights," and received roughly 154,200 likes in three days (shown below, right).

Online Reactions
Inspired by emily_murnane's reposting of CelebJets' information, Twitter users and others across social media levied backlash against Jenner for her short flights. For instance, Twitter[8] user hurtywurty tweeted a reply on July 17th, 2022, that revealed Jenner's flight was only a 44-minute drive, earning over 5,000 likes in two days (shown below, left). On July 16th, Twitter[9] user EthanMarkMusic tweeted screenshots of the comment section on Jenner's Instagram[5] post, revealing many users attacking Jenner for her "carbon footprint." The tweet received roughly 9,300 likes in three days (shown below, right).
TikTokers also talked about the controversy in videos continuing into July 2022. For instance, on July 18th, 2022, TikToker[10] internwatts posted a video where he green-screened himself in front of CelebJets' tweet.[2] The TikTok received roughly 1.6 million plays and 272,400 likes in less than a day (shown below, left).
