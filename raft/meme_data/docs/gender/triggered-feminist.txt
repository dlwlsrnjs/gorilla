About
Triggered Feminist, also known as Angry Feminist and Ficki Fiona, refers to a photoshop meme based around a still image of a woman with short hair and glasses appearing angry during a confrontation with supporters of Donald Trump. Online, images of the woman are often used in image macros, photoshops and animated GIFs in jokes about "triggering" feminists and left-wing activists.

Origin
On June 1st, 2016, The Alex Jones Channel YouTube channel uploaded a video titled "Trump Supporters Shut Down Protesters" (shown below). In the video, a woman with short hair wearing glasses is shown arguing with a man about statistics about SA against women. The original video was removed following YouTube's ban of all InfoWars channels in 2017.
