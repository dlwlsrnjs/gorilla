Rentoid

About
Rentoid is a slang term started on the subreddit /r/LoveForLandlords,[1] where users frequently roleplay as stereotypically bad landlords, used to refer to bad tenants who pay rent, but are annoying, presumably because they're anti-landlord, leading the landlord to want them gone anyway. The term is used to mock those with left-leaning politics and people who are anti-landlord.

Origin
On October 18th, 2019, /r/LandlordLove was created as a space for those with bad landlord experiences to share them, as well as create memes and share articles about landlords acting poorly.

On May 3rd, 2020, /r/LoveForLandlords was created to, according to the About Community section, "appreciate the essential role of landlords in society." On May 3rd, a now-deleted user posted, "Rentoids: please do not use the word "landord", or at least don't use a hard "R". It's our word. Consider using "landlawd" or, even better, the phrase "person of means" to the subreddit[2] (shown below, left). This is the first known use of the term on the site.
The term, as well as others used on the subreddit, is part of the forum's official wiki[3] (shown below, right).
