About
Let Them Eat Cake refers to an alleged quote from the former queen of France Marie Antoinette who purportedly said it in response to the plight of the peasants who had no bread to eat. Historians have debated whether or not she said the quote. The catchphrase was included in the 2006 film Marie Antoinette. In memes, "Let Them Eat Cake" became a notable TikTok sound in 2023 and 2024. TikToker Haleyybaylee also gained controversy for her usage of the "Let Them Eat Cake" sound at the 2024 Met Gala.

Origin
"Let them eat cake" is a quote attributed to Marie Antoinette, the queen of France during the French Revolution. It was allegedly the queenâ€™s response upon being told that her starving peasant subjects had no bread.[1] However, historians have questioned whether Marie Antoinette said the phrase. The first record of the phrase was in French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Book VI of his Confessions (1767), attributed to an unnamed "great princess." Antoinette would have been 12 at the time.[1]

On October 20th, 2006, the film Marie Antoinette starring Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette premiered in American theaters.[2] In one scene, the voice of a revolutionary is heard talking to a crowd about Marie Antoinette saying, "Let them eat cake," using a clip of Dunst in a bathtub saying the phrase (YouTube[3] upload shown below).
