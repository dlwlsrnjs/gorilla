About
Check Your Basement is a reference to the 2019 thriller film Parasite in which a wealthy family has a man living in their basement without their knowledge. Online, people use the catchphrase as a response to others sharing photographs of their expensive homes and flaunting their wealth.


Origin
On October 5th, 2019, the film Parasite was released in the United States. In the film, director Bong Joon Ho creates a metaphor for income inequality and economic classes through a wealthy family's home. One of the film's major plot points involves a man living in the family's basement unbeknownst to them.[1]

On January 5th, 2020, Twitter [2] user @boojanglies responded to a tweet by supermodel Chrissy Teigen praising the film, "Check your basement chrissy" as a means of criticizing her wealth and possibly misunderstanding the film (shown below).

The tweet received more than 8.4 million views, 248,000 likes and 53,000 retweets in less than two months (shown below, center).
