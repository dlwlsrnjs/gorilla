    "reasoning": "This meme directly references the \"Karen\" character, which is defined as an irritating and entitled woman often depicted in various memes, as outlined in Document 0. The meme suggests that \"Karen memes\" are significant enough that they cannot be ignored, indicating their cultural relevance. The other documents (1, 2, and 3) are distractors and do not pertain to the understanding of the \"Karen\" phenomenon. Thus, option B is the most accurate choice.",

Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts.

    "reasoning": "To determine the cultural phenomenon referenced in the meme, we can analyze the provided documents. Document 2 specifically discusses the term \"Karen,\" describing it as a pejorative for an irritating and entitled woman, particularly in contexts where such individuals are filmed harassing people. This aligns perfectly with option A, as it captures the essence of what the term \"Karen\" represents in meme culture. The other options (B, C, and D) do not relate directly to the context of the meme or the characterization of Karen as discussed in Document 2. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",
    "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: A",
    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme references the cultural phenomenon surrounding \"Karen,\" which is characterized by the portrayal of entitled behavior, often linked to white women who complain or call authorities over trivial matters. Document 3 discusses the origins and usage of the term \"Karen,\" highlighting its connection to social entitlement and incidents where individuals have called the police without cause. The other documents (0, 1, 2) do not provide relevant context to the meme. Therefore, the correct answer relates to the concept of social entitlement among certain demographics.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What metaphorical meaning is conveyed through the expression in the meme titled \"karen_2\"?\n\nA) The inevitability of confronting entitled behavior  \nB) The simplicity of ignoring social issues  \nC) The uniqueness of each individual's experience  \nD) The irony of common social behaviors",
    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme, we need to refer to Document 0, which discusses the \"Karen\" character as an embodiment of annoying, entitled behaviors, particularly in situations involving social entitlement and racial dynamics. The phrase \"One does not simply ignore Karen memes\" suggests that these memes represent a widespread social commentary that cannot be overlooked, linking to the idea that entitled behaviors (represented by \"Karen\") are pervasive and require attention rather than dismissal. \n\nOptions B and C do not align with the context of the \"Karen\" meme, as they either trivialize serious issues or focus on individual experiences, which are not the main themes associated with \"Karen.\" Option D is also less relevant as it doesn't capture the essence of being unable to ignore the societal implications of the behavior depicted.\n\nThus, the best choice is A, as it emphasizes the inevitability of confronting and addressing behaviors associated with the \"Karen\" archetype.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** In the meme titled \"karen_2,\" which depicts a man talking on a cell phone, what metaphorical meaning is likely being conveyed about the character \"Karen\"?\n\nA) Karen is busy making important decisions.  \nB) Karen is heard complaining to someone about an insignificant issue.  \nC) Karen is seeking assistance from a professional.  \nD) Karen is expressing excitement about a new opportunity.",
    "reasoning": "The context suggests that \"Karen\" is typically portrayed as an entitled and irritating character, known for her complaints and often unnecessary demands (as detailed in Document 2). The image of a man talking on a cell phone can symbolize communication regarding trivial matters or complaints, which aligns with the stereotype of \"Karen\" as someone who often calls attention to insignificant issues. Therefore, the most fitting interpretation is option B, where Karen is heard complaining about something trivial to someone else.

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What metaphorical meaning is conveyed through the expression in the meme featuring the caption \"One does not simply ignore Karen memes\"?\n\nA) Karen memes are universally recognized and should be acknowledged.  \nB) Ignoring issues related to privilege is acceptable.  \nC) Humor should not be taken seriously.  \nD) All memes are equally relevant.",
    "reasoning": "The meme refers to the character of \"Karen,\" which has been characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, often used to address issues of privilege and social behavior, as explained in Document 3. The phrase \"One does not simply ignore\" implies that Karen memes are significant and part of a broader cultural conversation. Thus, option A is correct; it captures the essence of acknowledging the impact and recognition of Karen memes in societal discussions. The other options do not align with this interpretation. The distractor documents (0, 1, 2) do not contribute to understanding the metaphorical meaning of the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The meme titled \"One does not simply ignore Karen memes\" uses a well-known format to humorously emphasize the prevalence and cultural significance of the \"Karen\" stereotype. Document 1 provides context about the \"Karen\" character and its association with entitlement and annoyance, making it clear that the meme is satirizing how commonly this stereotype is referenced in discussions and humor. The other options do not reflect the essence of the meme or the context provided in the oracle document.

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "Question: In what way does this meme incorporate satirical elements?\n\nA) It highlights the absurdity of everyday communication through a literal interpretation of a phone call.  \nB) It mocks the stereotype of a \"Karen\" by suggesting she is always involved in unnecessary conflicts.  \nC) It presents a serious portrayal of conflict resolution between two men.  \nD) It emphasizes the importance of technology in modern communication.",
    "reasoning": "The correct answer is B) because the meme likely references the \"Karen\" stereotype, which is characterized by entitled behavior and creating unnecessary conflicts, as detailed in Document 3. This document explains the origins and spread of the \"Karen\" meme, particularly in relation to social conflicts in various scenarios. The image caption, which shows a man talking on a cell phone, could imply that he is involved in a conflict typical of \"Karen\" situations, thus satirizing that stereotype. The other options do not align with the essence of the \"Karen\" meme as described in the oracle document. Options A, C, and D do not incorporate the satirical elements associated with the \"Karen\" character and her behavior.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018.

Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme uses the phrase \"One does not simply ignore Karen memes,\" which satirically acknowledges the prevalence and humor surrounding the \"Karen\" stereotype. Document 3 provides context about the \"Karen\" character and its cultural significance in memes, emphasizing how the term is often used to mock entitled behavior. Options A and D misinterpret the intent by framing it as a blanket statement against women, while option C does not align with the humorous nature of the meme. Thus, option B accurately captures the satirical essence of the meme.",

In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme effectively, we refer to the oracle document which discusses the character \"Karen,\" who is often depicted as an entitled white woman, especially in scenarios of social conflict with people of color. The document highlights instances where \"Karen\" characters have been involved in confrontations with individuals from minority groups, particularly in the context of calling the police or making complaints without valid reasons. This directly relates to option B, which portrays the opposition between white women (Karens) and people of color, reflecting the social conflicts often illustrated in these memes. The other options (A, C, D) do not relate to the specific social conflict dynamics surrounding the \"Karen\" meme as described in the oracle document. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",

    "reasoning": "The meme and its caption reference the \"Karen\" phenomenon, which often highlights conflicts between entitled individuals (often white women characterized as \"Karens\") and marginalized groups, particularly people of color. The relevant document (Document 0) explains the origins and implications of the \"Karen\" stereotype and addresses how it has been used to mock individuals in positions of privilege who display entitled behavior, particularly against marginalized communities.

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** How does the meaning of the meme change when the text is viewed without the accompanying image?\n\nA) The text alone suggests that ignoring all memes is acceptable.  \nB) The image provides context that emphasizes the seriousness of ignoring \"Karen\" memes.  \nC) The meme's humor relies solely on the text provided.  \nD) The image distracts from the message of the text completely.",
    "reasoning": "The image features a well-known scene from \"The Lord of the Rings\" with a character expressing an important sentiment. This visual context amplifies the meaning of the text, which humorously states that \"one does not simply ignore Karen memes.\" Document 2 provides background on the concept of \"Karen\" in memes, highlighting its association with entitlement and annoyance. This knowledge helps clarify that the humor lies in the cultural significance of \"Karen\" and the implication that these memes are pervasive and relevant. Without the image, the humor may be diminished as the visual connection to the popular culture reference is lost. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it reflects the importance of the image in conveying the meme's full meaning.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018.

Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "To answer this question, we analyze the documents provided, particularly focusing on Document 1, which outlines the character of \"Karen\" and how she is often depicted in memes. The image of a man talking on the phone hints at a potential conflict or complaint, which aligns with the typical portrayal of a \"Karen\" character. Without the image, the text does not convey the same level of implied confrontation or context that the image provides. Therefore, the answer is that the image adds essential context that is crucial for understanding the meme. This makes option C the most accurate choice. The other options either misinterpret the role of the image or assert that the text stands alone without loss.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The oracle document (Document 0) provides a detailed background on the \"Karen\" meme, emphasizing its role in social commentary and humor regarding entitled behavior. The image caption introduces a contrasting scenario of a man on a cell phone, which does not directly relate to the essence of the \"Karen\" meme.

The image caption suggests a scenario where a man is on the phone, possibly indicating a situation of confrontation or complaint, which aligns with the negative connotations of the \"Karen\" stereotype. The other documents (0, 1, and 2) are distractor documents that do not provide context or insight into the \"Karen\" meme. Therefore, option B accurately reflects the viewpoint presented in the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme features a character that embodies the \"Karen\" stereotype, often depicted as entitled and demanding. The text emphasizes a trivial complaint about toilet paper, which reflects the exaggerated nature of the \"Karen\" character. Document 3 provides a detailed explanation of the \"Karen\" stereotype, outlining its origins and cultural context. In contrast, the distractor documents do not provide relevant information about the \"Karen\" character or the specific meme context. Thus, option B accurately captures the essence of the meme, highlighting the perception of entitlement that the \"Karen\" character represents.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme utilizes the \"Karen\" stereotype, which is characterized by a sense of entitlement and a tendency to complain about trivial matters, as highlighted in Document 3. The caption reflects an exaggerated response to a serious situation, illustrating the absurdity of demanding to \"speak to the manager\" of a global crisis like the coronavirus. Therefore, option B, which focuses on the entitlement often associated with the \"Karen\" stereotype, is the most relevant.

Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "reasoning": "The meme utilizes the character \"Karen\" to symbolize entitlement and frustration in consumer interactions, particularly during a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. The text suggests that \"Karen\" is upset about her coupon being rejected and then escalates her complaint to an absurd level, wanting to speak to the manager of the coronavirus. This aligns closely with the descriptions in the oracle document (Document 3), which explains the \"Karen\" meme as an antagonistic character often portrayed in frustrating situations. The other documents are distractors and do not provide relevant context for interpreting the meme's social message. Therefore, option A best captures the essence of the meme.",

    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme titled \"karen_1,\" we can refer to Document 1, which explains the \"Karen\" trope as representing an irritating, entitled character often involved in social conflicts, particularly with people of color. The presence of a woman holding a sign likely indicates a protest or a statement, which aligns with the critique of the \"Karen\" stereotype. The other documents (0, 2, 3) are distractors and do not provide relevant information regarding the character or social message of \"Karen.\" Therefore, Option B is the most appropriate answer as it directly relates to the social commentary on entitlement and behavior associated with the \"Karen\" figure.",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme features a woman, likely representing a \"Karen,\" who expresses frustration over a trivial issue (a coupon for toilet paper) while being in the midst of a serious situation, indicated by the presence of emergency responders in the background. This aligns closely with the character of \"Karen,\" who is often portrayed as entitled and demanding, as discussed in Document 1. Furthermore, the caption \"I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER OF THE CORONAVIRUS\" emphasizes the absurd expectation that one can manage or control a global crisis like a virus, making option C the most relevant interpretation. Options A and B reflect elements of the meme but do not capture its deeper social critique as effectively as option C. Option D, while related to communication, does not directly address the essence of the meme. \n\nThus, the correct answer is C.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What is the social meaning behind the humor used in the meme titled \"karen_1\"?\n\nA) It highlights the absurdity of demanding authority over situations beyond personal control.  \nB) It mocks the healthcare system's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nC) It promotes stereotypes about women complaining in public.  \nD) It serves as a serious critique of consumer culture during crises.",
    "reasoning": "The meme utilizes the character of \"Karen,\" which is well characterized in Document 1 as an entitled individual who often demands to speak to a manager, representing a broader critique of privilege and entitlement. The humor stems from the exaggerated situation where a woman wants to speak to the \"manager of the coronavirus,\" highlighting the absurdity of trying to control a global pandemic through entitlement. This aligns with the information in Document 1, which discusses the nature of \"Karen\" as a stereotype in social discourse.

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout.

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What does the meme titled \"karen_1,\" featuring a woman in a black dress holding a sign, likely represent in terms of social commentary?\n\nA) The empowerment of women in public spaces  \nB) The stereotype of entitled behavior often associated with the term \"Karen\"  \nC) A critique of fashion choices among women  \nD) A humorous take on political protests",
    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme effectively, we can refer to Document 1, which provides a comprehensive overview of the term \"Karen\" and its social implications. It describes \"Karen\" as a pejorative term often used to characterize entitled and irritating behavior, particularly by white women. The image caption mentions a woman holding a sign, which suggests public demonstration or protest, tying into the stereotype of \"Karen\" as someone who often demands to speak to a manager or create a scene in public. The other documents do not pertain to the concept of \"Karen\" or its social implications, making Document 1 crucial for understanding the humor and social meaning behind the meme. Therefore, the most appropriate interpretation of the meme is option B, as it directly relates to the stereotype of entitled behavior associated with the \"Karen\" meme culture.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Multiple-Choice Question:**\n\nWhat is the social meaning behind the humor used in the meme featuring a woman demanding to speak to the \"manager of the coronavirus\"?\n\nA) It highlights the absurdity of people blaming external entities for personal inconveniences.\n\nB) It portrays the woman as a hero fighting against a viral threat.\n\nC) It reflects a serious commentary on the impacts of the pandemic.\n\nD) It suggests that the woman is genuinely confused about the virus.",
    "reasoning": "The humor in this meme plays on the stereotype of a \"Karen,\" a term described in Document 2, which captures the essence of entitled and demanding behavior. The meme illustrates a cartoonish exaggeration of a person who believes they can resolve a global issue (the coronavirus) by simply speaking to its \"manager,\" emphasizing the absurdity of such a viewpoint. This aligns with the satirical nature of the \"Karen\" character, who often blames others for her inconveniences. Therefore, option A is the most relevant answer. Options B, C, and D misinterpret the humorous intent of the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme plays on the stereotype of \"Karen,\" which represents an entitled individual who demands to speak to a manager, reflecting a sense of entitlement in consumer-related situations. The context of the meme suggests a heightened frustration related to a pandemic, but it primarily showcases the stereotypical reaction of wanting to address authority regarding grievances, which fits option B. Document 2 discusses the \"Karen\" character and how it has been used in memes to depict entitlement and annoyance in various scenarios, making it relevant to the answer. Other options do not align as closely with the meme's focus on entitlement in a consumer context.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme clearly reflects the character of \"Karen,\" who is often depicted as an entitled individual demanding to speak to a manager, even in absurd situations, such as the coronavirus crisis. Document 1 discusses the origin and characteristics of the \"Karen\" meme, highlighting how this persona embodies entitlement and annoyance in social situations. Therefore, option B, which emphasizes the entitlement and complaints of individuals during crises, directly aligns with the depiction in the meme. Options A, C, and D do not capture the essence of the \"Karen\" character as effectively as option B does.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme uses the character \"Karen\" to illustrate a sense of entitlement and frustration, particularly in the context of an unusual and challenging situation like a pandemic. The text \"I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER OF THE CORONAVIRUS\" directly reflects the typical \"Karen\" stereotype of demanding to speak to a manager when faced with an issue, showing her entitlement. Document 2 elaborates on the \"Karen\" meme's characteristics and its implications of entitlement, which is relevant for understanding the relationship between the image and text in the meme. The other options do not align with the established characteristics of the \"Karen\" meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "Question: What does the image of a woman in a black dress holding a sign likely represent in the context of the \"Karen\" meme?\n\nA) A protest against social injustice  \nB) A depiction of an entitled woman demanding to speak to a manager  \nC) An art exhibit related to fashion  \nD) A scene from a movie about friendship",
    "reasoning": "The context documents explain the characteristics and social implications of the \"Karen\" meme, particularly highlighting how the term \"Karen\" is used to describe entitled and irritating behaviors, often associated with women in demanding situations (Document 1). The image caption, featuring a woman holding a sign, suggests a scenario that could be related to a public display or confrontation, aligning more closely with option B, which reflects the stereotypical behavior of a \"Karen\" demanding attention or service. The other options do not align with the documented characteristics of the \"Karen\" meme or its social connotations. Thus, the most relevant answer is B.",
    "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: B",
    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme leverages the \"Karen\" stereotype, which is well-explained in Document 0 as representing a sense of entitlement and frustration in trivial matters, often escalating them absurdly. The caption and context of the meme, where the character complains about not getting a coupon accepted during a pandemic, aligns with this characterization. The other distractor options do not accurately represent the meaning of the \"Karen\" meme. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen.

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen.

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The correct answer is found in Document 1, which discusses the definition of \"Karen\" as an antagonistic character representing an entitled woman who often exhibits irritating behaviors, particularly towards marginalized groups. The context of the meme suggests a critical stance on the entitlement associated with individuals labeled as \"Karen.\" Options A, C, and D do not align with the critical nature of the term as described in the document. Therefore, option B is the most accurate representation of the criticism associated with the term \"Karen.\"",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What viewpoint does the meme \"karen_1\" present regarding societal reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nA) It emphasizes the importance of following health guidelines during a crisis.  \nB) It critiques individuals who express entitlement during difficult situations.  \nC) It highlights the resilience of communities facing challenges.  \nD) It suggests that personal grievances are trivial in the context of a pandemic.",
    "reasoning": "The meme features a character typically associated with entitlement and annoyance, known as \"Karen,\" who is humorously demanding to speak to the \"manager\" of the coronavirus. This aligns with the characterization of \"Karen\" as outlined in Document 2, where she is depicted as an irritating, entitled woman. The caption suggests a critique of individuals who focus on personal inconveniences instead of the larger crisis at hand, making option B the most relevant viewpoint. The distractor documents (0, 1, 3) do not provide relevant insights into the meme's context.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live.

He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout.

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

    "reasoning": "To determine the cultural context reflected in the meme \"karen_3,\" we can refer to Document 1, which discusses the origin and spread of the \"Karen\" meme. The use of the term \"Karen\" became widely popular in the late 2010s, particularly around 2020, when it was associated with social media trends and events such as the Central Park incident. The image caption of a man in a suit talking on a cell phone suggests a modern business context, likely aligning with the cultural trends of the 2010s and 2020s, as cell phones became ubiquitous during this period. Therefore, the culture reflected in the meme is most indicative of the 2010s or 2020s. Given that the term \"Karen\" became prominent specifically in the 2020s, particularly in relation to social issues, the correct answer is D) The 2020s.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme references the concept of \"Karen,\" which has become a cultural phenomenon primarily in the late 2010s, especially around 2020 with the rise of viral incidents involving entitled behavior by women dubbed \"Karens.\" The context in Document 0 discusses the emergence of the term \"Karen\" and its implications in contemporary culture, particularly in the context of social media. The humor in the meme plays on the stereotype of a middle-aged woman wanting to \"speak to the manager,\" which aligns with the cultural discussions from the 2010s. The other documents (1, 2, 3) are distractors and do not provide relevant information to the question. Therefore, the correct answer is D) The 2010s.",

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously questions the existence of babies named \"Karen,\" implying that the name is predominantly associated with entitled middle-aged women who demand to speak to managers, as supported by Document 2. This document outlines how the term \"Karen\" has evolved to represent a stereotype of behavior rather than just a name. Options A and B are relevant, but A more accurately captures the metaphorical meaning of the meme. Options C and D do not align with the documented understanding of the term's cultural resonance. Hence, the best choice is A.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live.

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What metaphorical meaning is conveyed through the expression in the meme featuring a man in a suit talking on a cell phone with the keyword \"karen\"?\n\nA) The man represents authority and the need to address complaints.  \nB) The man symbolizes the frustrations of dealing with entitled individuals.  \nC) The man indicates a corporate perspective on social conflicts.  \nD) The man signifies a casual attitude towards customer service issues.",
    "reasoning": "To understand the metaphorical meaning conveyed in the meme, we can reference Document 2, which outlines the persona of \"Karen\" as an entitled and irritating character often involved in social conflicts. The keyword \"karen\" in the meme suggests that the man, likely representing an authority figure (since he is in a suit), is dealing with the complaints or demands that are characteristic of a \"Karen\" figure. Thus, option A, which highlights the authority aspect, aligns with the context of the meme. However, option B captures the essence of frustration often portrayed in memes about \"Karen,\" making it a strong candidate as well. Options C and D, while plausible, do not capture the specific metaphorical conflict implied by the meme. Therefore, the best interpretation is related to the frustrations of dealing with the archetype of \"Karen,\" which is option B.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout.

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What metaphorical meaning is conveyed through the expression in the meme featuring the character asking whether babies named \"Karen\" exist?\n\nA) The name Karen symbolizes entitlement and demands for authority.  \nB) The name Karen represents a generational shift in social behavior.  \nC) The name Karen is used to question the existence of a stereotype.  \nD) The name Karen signifies a common naming trend among parents.",
    "reasoning": "The meme uses humor to highlight the stereotype associated with the name \"Karen,\" particularly how it has come to symbolize entitled behavior and the desire to speak to authority figures (like managers). This aligns with the information in Document 3, which discusses how \"Karen\" is characterized as an annoying, entitled woman who often demands to speak to managers. Therefore, option A accurately captures the metaphorical meaning of the meme. Options B, C, and D are less relevant as they do not directly address the stereotype's roots in entitlement and authority.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen.

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What social phenomenon is being mocked through the expression in the meme titled \"karen_3\"?\n\nA) Corporate greed  \nB) Entitled behavior of certain individuals, often referred to as \"Karens\"  \nC) Environmental activism  \nD) Social media influence on public opinion",
    "reasoning": "The context provided in document 2 discusses the term \"Karen,\" which is used to describe an entitled and often irritating female character who engages in disruptive behaviors, particularly in public settings. The meme's image caption, featuring a man in a suit talking on a cell phone, likely implies a formal or corporate setting where entitled behavior or complaints might arise, aligning with the characteristics associated with \"Karens.\" Thus, option B directly relates to the phenomenon being mocked in the meme, which is the entitled behavior of individuals often referred to as \"Karens.\" The other options do not pertain to the social phenomenon addressed in the meme. Distractor documents (0, 1, 3) do not provide relevant information for understanding the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen.

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously questions whether babies named \"Karen\" exist or if the name is only associated with women who exhibit entitled behavior, particularly those who demand to \"speak to the manager.\" This directly relates to the concept of the \"Karen\" meme, which is elaborated upon in Document 1. This document discusses the characterization of \"Karen\" as an irritating, entitled woman, often seen in humorous contexts, thus providing context that supports option A as the correct answer. The other options do not align with the meme's focus on the stereotype surrounding the name \"Karen.\"",
    "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: A",
    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously questions the existence of \"Karens\" in their youth, suggesting that they only emerge as entitled adults who often demand to speak to managers. This aligns with the cultural critique of the \"Karen\" stereotype, which represents entitlement and privilege, thus highlighting an ideological clash regarding societal expectations and behavior. Document 2 provides context about the origins and societal implications of the \"Karen\" meme, supporting the idea that the meme critiques entitlement associated with this character. The other documents (0, 1, 3) are irrelevant distractors.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What ideological clash within society is expressed through the meme titled \"karen_3,\" featuring a man in a suit talking on a cell phone?\n\nA) The conflict between authority figures and everyday citizens.  \nB) The struggle for racial equality and the critique of privileged behaviors.  \nC) The tension between traditional gender roles and modern expectations.  \nD) The divide between urban and rural lifestyles.",
    "reasoning": "To answer this question, we refer primarily to Document 0, which explains the character \"Karen\" as a symbol of entitlement and privilege, particularly associated with white women who display antagonistic behaviors, often toward marginalized individuals. This reflects a broader ideological clash related to societal privilege and issues of race, particularly in contexts where \"Karens\" have been involved in racially charged incidents, such as the Central Park incident mentioned in the document. \n\nWhile options A, C, and D might contain elements of societal conflict, they do not directly relate to the meme's focus on the \"Karen\" stereotype and its implications regarding race and privilege, as highlighted in Document 0. Therefore, option B, which addresses racial equality and critiques of privileged behaviors, aligns best with the meme's context and the information provided in the relevant document. \n\nThus, the correct answer is B.",

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously questions the existence of babies named \"Karen,\" suggesting that those named Karen only surface later in life as entitled individuals who demand to \"speak to the manager.\" This aligns with the stereotype of \"Karen\" as presented in the oracle document, which discusses how the term represents irritating, entitled behavior, often associated with white women. The other options do not directly connect to the central theme of the meme, making option B the most relevant. The distractor documents do not provide pertinent information to analyze the ideological clash.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme plays on the stereotype of the \"Karen\" persona, which is characterized by entitled behavior and a demand to speak to a manager, as described in Document 3. The text humorously suggests that babies named Karen do not exist and that they only materialize as adults, reflecting the negative stereotype associated with the name. This aligns with the usage of \"Karen\" in the context of memes and social commentary noted in the document. The other options do not capture the irony and humor presented in the meme.

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "question_with_options": "Question: What does the image of a man in a suit talking on a cell phone combined with the meme title \"karen_3\" likely convey about the character \"Karen\"?\n\nA) It depicts a professional woman who is assertive and competent.  \nB) It suggests that the man is about to confront a \"Karen\" about her entitled behavior.  \nC) It highlights the absurdity of someone named Karen being involved in a professional setting.  \nD) It implies that \"Karen\" is a term that applies to men in suits as well.",
    "reasoning": "The relevant document is Document 0, which explains the character \"Karen\" as an entitled and often irritating figure, particularly associated with negative behaviors such as complaining or demanding to speak to a manager. The meme title \"karen_3\" indicates a connection to this character. The image of a man in a suit talking on a phone may suggest a scenario where he is preparing to address or confront a \"Karen,\" who is typically depicted as causing disruption or demanding special treatment. Thus, option B is the most fitting interpretation of the combination of the image and the meme title. Options A and C do not align with the negative connotations associated with \"Karen,\" and option D misinterprets the character's application. Therefore, option B is correct.",

    "reasoning": "The meme utilizes the character's image from a popular movie to humorously question the logic behind the stereotype that women named Karen are always entitled and confrontational. The text implies that the name has become synonymous with a particular attitude, often associated with older women, thus questioning whether babies named Karen actually exist or if the stereotype develops only in adulthood. Document 1 provides background on the \"Karen\" meme, explaining its association with entitlement and annoyance, which supports the interpretation of option B. The other options do not align closely with the main theme of the meme as described in the documents.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme plays on the stereotype of women named \"Karen\" as being entitled and demanding, particularly the trope of wanting to \"speak to the manager.\" This aligns directly with the characterizations discussed in Document 3, which explains the origin and spread of the \"Karen\" meme as a pejorative for entitled behavior. The other options do not capture the essence of the meme's commentary on social issues related to entitlement and racially charged behavior. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

The specific mention of a man in a suit talking on a cell phone may hint at corporate or professional entitlement, which aligns with the criticisms associated with \"Karens.\" Document 0 discusses how \"Karen\" represents certain social conflicts, particularly focusing on entitlement and racial issues.

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

    "reasoning": "The meme humorously questions the existence of babies named \"Karen,\" suggesting that the name is associated more with older women who exhibit entitled and demanding behavior, often depicted in memes as wanting to \"speak to the manager.\" This aligns with the characterization described in Document 1, which explains how \"Karen\" has become a pejorative term for certain behaviors exhibited by some women, particularly in social and racial contexts. The other options do not directly relate to the specific critique of entitled behavior associated with the \"Karen\" meme, making option A the most relevant answer.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme references the \"Karen\" phenomenon, which arose prominently in popular culture during the 2010s. Document 2 explains the origin and spread of the term \"Karen,\" indicating its association with entitled behavior, particularly in the context of interactions involving people of color. The meme's humor hinges on the irony of someone embodying this stereotype (a \"Karen\") complaining about others exhibiting similar behavior, a reflection of cultural discussions that gained traction in the late 2010s. The distractor documents do not provide relevant context for this specific cultural moment. Therefore, the correct answer is D) The 2010s.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "To determine which era or generation's culture is reflected in the meme, it is crucial to analyze the context of the term \"Karen\" as explained in document 1. The term \"Karen\" is used as a pejorative to describe a specific stereotype of entitled behavior, particularly associated with white women, and has become widely recognized in memes and social media since around 2020. The example of \"Central Park Karen\" and the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped further illustrate the contemporary context in which the term is used, indicating a strong connection to 2020s social media culture. The other options (A, B, C) do not align with this timeframe or the characteristics of the meme. Therefore, the correct answer is D) 2020s Social Media Culture.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme references the \"Karen\" archetype, which gained significant prominence in the 2010s, particularly with the rise of social media and viral content. The context provided in Document 0 discusses the evolution of the term \"Karen,\" including its use in memes and viral incidents involving entitled behaviors attributed to women, particularly after 2020. The caption suggests a humorous take on the phenomenon of \"Karens\" complaining about similar behaviors, indicating a socio-cultural critique common in 2010s internet culture. The distractor documents do not provide relevant context. Thus, the correct answer is D) 2010s.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther.

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout.

    "reasoning": "The meme reflects the irony of individuals labeled as \"Karens\" (a term associated with entitled behavior) complaining about similar behavior from others. This aligns with the explanations in document ID 1, which discusses the characteristics and societal perceptions of \"Karens.\" The presence of \"complaining\" in the text of the meme reinforces this notion of hypocrisy, making option A the most relevant interpretation. The other options do not capture this irony and are less connected to the provided context, making them distractors.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "To understand the symbolism of this meme, we can refer to Document 2, which explains that \"Karen\" is a slang term used to portray an entitled and often annoying female character, typically associated with confrontational behavior. This aligns with the context of the meme, suggesting that the image of a woman posing with a man is likely meant to evoke the stereotype of a \"Karen,\" especially given the context of the meme's title. The other documents provided (0, 1, and 3) do not contain relevant information regarding the interpretation of the term \"Karen\" or its symbolic meaning in memes, making Document 2 the oracle document for this question. Thus, option B correctly interprets the symbolism in the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What does the meme titled \"Even Karens are complaining about karens\" symbolize regarding the behavior of the character \"Karen\"?\n\nA) Karens are often self-aware and reflective of their actions.  \nB) The character \"Karen\" represents hypocrisy in social behavior.  \nC) Karens are misunderstood and deserve sympathy.  \nD) The term \"Karen\" is outdated and no longer relevant.",
    "reasoning": "The meme illustrates a scenario where a woman, embodying the \"Karen\" stereotype, is complaining about others while being part of the same situation herself. This aligns with the concept of hypocrisy commonly associated with the character \"Karen,\" who is often portrayed as entitled and critical of others without recognizing her own similar behaviors. The relevant document (id=2) discusses the characteristics and societal perceptions of \"Karen,\" reinforcing the idea that the meme captures this hypocritical nature. The distractor documents do not contribute relevant information for interpreting the meme. Hence, option B is the most fitting interpretation.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen.

The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The meme features a woman expressing dissatisfaction about the beach being crowded after she herself drove a long distance to get there, illustrating a contradiction between her actions and her complaints. Document 2 provides context about the \"Karen\" character, known for entitlement and complaining about others, making it relevant to understanding the humorous irony in the meme. The distractor documents do not contribute to this analysis, as they do not relate to the meme's context. Thus, option B accurately captures the essence of the contradiction presented in the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "To answer the question, we refer to Document 1, which explains the characteristics of \"Karen\" as an irritating and entitled figure often depicted in memes. The meme's title \"karen_4\" suggests that it features a character embodying these traits. The options involve different emotions and actions displayed by the characters in the meme. Option A is the best fit because it highlights the contradiction of a woman (likely representing the \"Karen\" stereotype) appearing happy in a photo, while her actions may imply entitlement, a common trait associated with the \"Karen\" character. The other options do not directly relate to the stereotypical traits associated with \"Karen\" and do not present a clear contradiction linked to the theme of entitlement. Therefore, Document 1 provides the necessary context to identify the most relevant option.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me?

On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party.

We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "This meme showcases a situation where a woman, presumably a \"Karen,\" drives a significant distance to the beach only to complain about its crowdedness, which is ironic given that she chose to go there herself. This reflects the essence of the \"Karen\" stereotype as discussed in Document 2, where the term describes someone who is entitled and often complains about situations they participate in. Option B directly addresses this contradiction, making it the correct answer. The other options do not capture the irony presented in the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What structural inequality is exposed by this meme regarding the \"Karen\" stereotype?\n\nA) The stereotype of \"Karens\" reflects a broader societal issue of entitlement among certain demographics.  \nB) The meme highlights the lack of access to beaches for marginalized communities.  \nC) The behavior depicted in the meme shows that all individuals are equally entitled to complain about others.  \nD) The stereotype of \"Karen\" is solely about age, not race or class.",
    "reasoning": "The meme references the \"Karen\" stereotype, which is characterized by entitlement and nagging behavior, often associated with certain demographics, particularly middle-aged white women. Document 1 discusses the concept of \"Karen\" and how it has been used to criticize entitlement in social contexts, making option A the most relevant. Options B and C do not align with the meme's content or the context of the \"Karen\" stereotype, while option D misrepresents the multifaceted nature of the stereotype. Thus, the correct answer is A.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "reasoning": "The relevant document is Document 1, which discusses the character \"Karen\" as a symbol of entitlement and problematic behavior typically associated with certain demographics, particularly middle-aged white women. This aligns with option D, as the meme likely critiques the entitled behavior that \"Karen\" represents in social interactions. The other options do not directly relate to the character or the social conflict surrounding the term \"Karen.\" Therefore, the answer that best fits the structural inequality exposed by the meme is D.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

        "content": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

    "reasoning": "The meme captures the concept of \"Karen\" as an entitled character, who, even while embodying this stereotype, complains about others exhibiting similar behavior. This highlights a certain hypocrisy and entitlement that is often associated with the \"Karen\" meme, as discussed in Document 0, which explains the origins and characteristics of the \"Karen\" persona. The structural inequality exposed here primarily relates to the entitlement of individuals who feel they can complain about others without recognizing their own similar actions (Option A). Other options, while relevant to broader social issues, do not directly reflect the core theme of entitlement displayed in the meme. Therefore, the best answer is A.",

    "reasoning": "The meme features a woman (presumably a \"Karen\") complaining about other people at the beach after having driven a significant distance to go there herself. This aligns with the character of \"Karen\" as described in the oracle document, which discusses how \"Karens\" tend to exhibit entitled behavior. The caption \"Even Karens are complaining about karens\" suggests a self-referential hypocrisy among those who fit the \"Karen\" stereotype. Thus, option B accurately captures the essence of the meme. Options A, C, and D do not encapsulate the core message as effectively. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What does the image caption imply about the individuals in the meme titled \"karen_4\"?\n\nA) They are a couple enjoying a picnic.  \nB) The woman is embodying the \"Karen\" stereotype.  \nC) The man is annoyed by the woman's presence.  \nD) They are friends posing for a social media post.",
    "reasoning": "The image caption describes a woman and a man posing for a picture but does not provide any context that explicitly connects to the \"Karen\" stereotype. Document 0 describes \"Karen\" as a slang term for an irritating, entitled woman, often involved in social conflicts, but it doesn't link to the specifics of a couple or a friendly interaction. Therefore, the most relevant option that aligns with the theme of the meme related to the \"Karen\" stereotype would be option B, suggesting that the woman is embodying that stereotype. However, without clear evidence from the image or the caption, the relationship remains ambiguous. Hence, while B is the most plausible option given the context of the meme, none of the options are definitively supported by the provided documents. Therefore, after consideration, it seems that B is the most closely related to the theme of the meme.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004.

Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes.

    "reasoning": "The title and caption of the meme suggest a humorous take on the stereotype surrounding \"Karens,\" as detailed in Document 1, which explains the term \"Karen\" as an antagonistic character often complaining or being entitled. The image of a woman appearing frustrated supports this idea, showing a common scenario where \"Karens\" complain about others. Option A accurately reflects this relationship. Options B and D do not align with the context of the meme, and C incorrectly states that the text and image are unrelated. Therefore, A is the best answer.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated.

The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What underlying bias does the meme \"Even Karens are complaining about Karens\" suggest about societal behavior towards individuals labeled as \"Karens\"?\n\nA) It implies that all women are entitled and complain excessively.  \nB) It suggests that those labeled as \"Karens\" are hypocritical, as they engage in the same behaviors they criticize.  \nC) It indicates that everyone named Karen behaves in a similar manner, regardless of context.  \nD) It indicates that the term \"Karen\" is only used for comedic effect and has no real implications.",
    "reasoning": "The meme references the concept of \"Karen\" as characterized in Document 3, which discusses the negative stereotypes associated with this label, particularly the entitlement and complaining behavior often attributed to such individuals. The meme's phrasing suggests hypocrisy in individuals who criticize others for the same behaviors they exhibit themselves, which aligns with option B. The other options either make broader generalizations or misunderstand the context of the \"Karen\" stereotype. Thus, option B is the most relevant answer.",

    "oracle_doc": "About\nKaren is a slang term used as an antagonistic female character in memes. \"Karen\" is generally characterized as an irritating, entitled woman, sometimes as an ex-wife who took custody of \"the kids.\" In 2020, the term was broadly applied to a swath of white women who had been filmed harassing people of color, including dialing the emergency services on them for no criminal reason.\n\nOrigin\nWhile it's unclear where exactly \"Karen\" began seeing use as a pejorative character, it perhaps started with the Oh My God, Karen, You Can’t Just Ask Someone Why They're White meme from Mean Girls. Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left). Twitter users began using the hashtag to tweet comedic scenarios in which the Karen character would get frustrated. Twitter user @MunaNawabit1[6] tweeted, \"Found out that the study they funded to prove vaccines cause autism proved that vaccines don’t cause autism #AndThenKarenSnapped\" and garnered over 9,300 likes and 2,300 retweets in a day\n\nhat day, Twitter user @DeadStillPretty tweeted, \"#AndThenKarenSnapped When Karen demanded to speak to the manager and I told her I AM the manager\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 2,800 likes and 290 retweets in a day.\n\nCentral Park Karen\nCentral Park Karen is the white cop-caller nickname of Amy Cooper, who was recorded calling the police on an African American birder in Central Park in New York City after being asked by him to leash her dog in the park. After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions",

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What underlying social biases are suggested by the meme titled \"karen_4,\" which features a woman and a man posing for a picture?\n\nA) The portrayal of women as inferior to men  \nB) The stereotype of women as entitled and demanding, often referred to as \"Karens\"  \nC) The normalization of aggressive behavior in public  \nD) The expectation that women should always appear friendly and approachable",
    "reasoning": "To analyze the meme titled \"karen_4,\" it's important to reference Document 3, which provides a detailed explanation of the \"Karen\" stereotype. The term \"Karen\" is used in memes to depict an entitled, often irritating woman, which aligns with option B. This stereotype has been popularized through various social media instances and is rooted in societal prejudices about race and gender. The other options either do not directly relate to the concept of \"Karen\" or suggest biases that are not explicitly supported by the context of the meme or the document. Therefore, the most accurate answer is B, as it directly addresses the stereotype of women as demanding and entitled, which is central to the \"Karen\" meme phenomenon.",

Others believe that the popularity of the name may come from the character Karen from the 1989 gangster film Goodfellas\n\nSome believe that usage of the name as a perjorative stems from the Dane Cook standup comedy routine \"The Friend That Nobody Likes,\" which first appeared on the album Retaliation, released on July 26th, 2005 and recorded 2004. In the routine, Cook says:\nSo I'm hangin' out with all of my buddies, and uh, I realize something, I realize something. Think of the group of people you've known the longest in your life. Think of the group of friends you've hung out with the most, maybe you're all here tonight. And this is what I realized, I had an epiphany, and here it is, right here: There is one person, in every group of friends, that nobody f--king likes. You basically keep them there, to hate their guts. When that person is not around the rest of your little base camp, your hobby, is cutting that person down.\n\nExample: \"Karen, is always a douchebag.\"\nEvery group has a Karen and she is always a bag of douche.\nAnd when she's not around, you just look at each other and say,\n\"God, Karen, she's such a douchebag!\n\nSpread\nOn August 7th, 2015, comedian Jay Pharoah released the standup special Can I Be Me? In the special, he refers to an annoying woman named Karen. \"It's always a 'Karen,'\" he said.\nYears later, on October 23rd, 2020 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said of the joke, \"I'm the one who started, 'There's always a white woman named Karen.\"\nOne of the earliest widespread examples was Nintendo Switch Karen. On October 20th, 2016, Nintendo released the first trailer for the Nintendo Switch\nIn the trailer, a woman brings the Switch to a rooftop party. That day, Tumblr user joematar posted a joke about the woman arriving at the party with the caption “Oh shit, Karen brought her stupid Nintendo thing to the party again. We’re DRINKING, Karen. We’re having CONVERSATIONS.” As of December 27th, 2017, the post has over 23,000 notes\nOn December 7th, 2017, the subreddit /r/FuckYouKaren[1] was created, and has over 57,000 subscribers as of December 27th, 2018. The subreddit is devoted to mocking the character in jokes that characterize \"Karen\" as annoying. Many jokes revolve around the character having a specific style of haircut indicating her character\nOn March 18th, 2018, Urban Dictionary user Cody Kolodziejzyk posted a definition of \"Karen\" as an annoying middle-aged white woman.\nOn April 7th, 2018, Chadwick Boseman appeared on Saturday Night Live. [1] During a \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch, Boseman played T'challa from Black Panther. After struggling to understand the game, Boseman answers a question about a white person named Karen bringing her potato salad to a black person's cookout. Boseman says it is likely Karen did not season her food and likely added raisins to the potato salad, before answering \"Aw hell naw, Karen. Keep your bland-ass potato salad to yourself!\"\n\nAndThenKarenSnapped\nOn January 20th, 2020, the hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped[4] began trending after Twitter user @RiotGrlErin[5] first tweeted the hashtag after the stating \"The Apps were cold\" (shown below, left).

After video of the altercation went viral, Cooper apologized for the incident.\n\nOn May 25th, 2020, Christian Cooper published video of the altercation with Amy Cooper (no relation), which took place in the Ramble, a popular section of Central Park for bird watching. He wrote:\n\nCentral Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.\n\nME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.\nHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.\nME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.\nHER: It's too dangerous.\nME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.\nHER: What's that?\nME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!\nHER: He won't come to you.\nME: We'll see about that…\n\nI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.\n\nHER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!\n\nThat's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn…\nThe video received more than 12,000 comments, 7,200 shares and 6,900 reactions"

    "question_with_options": "**Question:** What underlying assumptions or biases are present in the meme titled \"Even Karens are complaining about karens\"?\n\nA) It suggests that all women named Karen are entitled and complain excessively.  \nB) It implies that complaints about others are hypocritical when made by individuals who behave similarly.  \nC) It indicates that beach-goers should not complain, regardless of the circumstances.  \nD) It portrays humor as a means to criticize social behavior without serious consequences.",
    "reasoning": "The meme plays on the stereotype of \"Karen\" as an entitled and complaining figure, as discussed in Document 0, which explains the character's origin and characteristics. The caption highlights a situation where a woman (presumably a \"Karen\") complains about others while exhibiting the same behavior herself, illustrating the bias of hypocrisy in complaints. Option B directly addresses this hypocrisy, aligning with the theme of the meme. Options A and C introduce broader assumptions about women or complainants that are not central to the meme's point, while D discusses humor's role without connecting to the specific critique presented. Therefore, the most relevant option based on the provided context is B.",
